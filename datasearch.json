The problem posed in this dataset is to recognize, given a sequence of DNA, the boundaries between exons (the parts of the DNA sequence retained after splicing) and introns (the parts of the DNA sequence that are spliced out). This problem consists of two subtasks: recognizing exon/intron boundaries (referred to as EI sites), and recognizing intron/exon boundaries (IE sites). (In the biological community, IE borders are referred to a ``acceptors'' while EI borders are referred to as ``donors''.)\n\nThis dataset has been developed to help evaluate a \"hybrid\" learning algorithm (KBANN) that uses examples to inductively refine preexisting knowledge.

Our hope was to cover most of the types of sensory interactions that a Pioneer might be reasonably expected to encounter: things like passing by visible objects, pushing visible objects, crashing into walls, etc. Many of these interactions are repeated throughout the dataset.\n\nThis data was collected to serve as the basis for work in learning and conceptual development. Our first goal was to be able to have the robot cluster these experiences by their dynamics on their own into clusters of experiences with a common outcome.\n\nEach data file contains time series data in which each row of data corresponds to a single observation of the sensor array. Included in each row are two additional variables, 'id' and 'description', which indicate the experience number that the observation belongs to, and a description of that experience, respectively. Observations within an experience are taken every 100ms.\n\nThe data is stored in three text files: one file for experiences in which the Pioneer was moving in a straight line, one in which it was turning in place, and one in which it was raising or lowering its gripper.\n\nThe description variable is a string of symbols. The string breaks down as follows:\n\n\"u\" or \"o\" - unobstructed or obstructed\n\"x.xs\" - activity lasted x.x seconds\nactivity - the activity and speed, if applicable, i.e. move100 = move forward at 100mm/sec\nvisual - objects in the visual array are listed in sequence. \"cAHEAD\" indicates an object visible to channel c directly AHEAD of the Pioneer.\n[visual.X] - visual descriptions followed by a '.' and one character indicate that something special happens with the visible object. .V means the object Vanishes from sight during the activity. .D indicates that the object is Discovered (becomes visible) during the activity. .P indicates that the object is pushed.\n\nAn example: \"u-3.5s-retr-100-aRIGHT.D\" An unobstructed retreat (move) at -100 mm/sec for 3.5 seconds with an object being discovered in channel A.\n\nIt should be noted that, particularly with respect to the visual channels, the description may not be 100% accurate. Since the visual channels respond to colors that they are trained on (visual a=red, visual b=yellow, visual c=blue), it was possible, but infrequent, for some extraneous object in the environment generated a response in visual channels that were not supposed to show activity in a particular trial.\n\nRows are seperated by carriage returns, columns by commas.", "Area": "Computer", "Number_of_Instances": "N/A", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Multivariate, Time-Series", "Name": "Pioneer-1 Mobile Robot Data Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pioneer-1+Mobile+Robot+Data", "Attribute_Information": "TRIAL-ID : categorical, the trial id of the experience that the observation belongs to\nDESCRIPTION : a symbolic description of the experience design\nTIME-SECS : a reading of the Pioneer's internal clock, in seconds\nBATTERY-LEVEL : a reading of battery level, in volts\nSONAR-0 : sonar depth reading, in mm, of the left (90) pointing sonar\nSONAR-1 : sonar depth reading, in mm, of a (15) pointing sonar\nSONAR-2 : sonar depth reading, in mm, of a (7.5) pointing sonar\nSONAR-3 : sonar depth reading, in mm, of a forward (0) pointing sonar\nSONAR-4 : sonar depth reading, in mm, of a (-7.5) pointing sonar\nSONAR-5 : sonar depth reading, in mm, of a (-15) pointing sonar\nSONAR-6 : sonar depth reading, in mm, of a right (-90) pointing sonar\nHEADING : heading reading, in degrees, from the robot's \"true north\"\nR-WHEEL-VEL : right wheel velocity, in mm/sec\nL-WHEEL-VEL : left wheel velocity, in mm/sec\nTRANS-VEL : translational velocity, mm/sec\nROT-VEL : rotational velocity, mm/sec\nR-STALL : right wheel stall sensor, binary (0/1)\nL-STALL : left wheel stall sensor, binary (0/1)\nROBOT-STATUS : robot status, 2.0 = stationary, 3.0 = moving\nGRIP-STATE : gripper state\nGRIP-FRONT-BEAM : gripper break beam, binary, 1.0 = broken\nGRIP-REAR-BEAM : gripper break beam, binary, 1.0 = broken\nGRIP-BUMPER : gripper bumper, binary, 1.0 = in contact\nVIS-A-AREA : area of dominant visible object for channel A, in pixels\nVIS-A-X : X location of object in channel A on image plane, -140 ... 140\nVIS-A-Y : Y location of channel A on image plane\nVIS-A-H : height of object in channel A on plane, in pixels\nVIS-A-W : width of object in A on image plane, in pixels\nVIS-A-DIST : distance to object in channel A, in mm\nVIS-B-AREA : area of dominant visible object for channel B, in pixels\nVIS-B-X : X location of object in channel B on image plane, -140 ... 140\nVIS-B-Y : Y location of channel B on image plane\nVIS-B-H : height of object in channel B on plane, in pixels\nVIS-B-W : width of object in B on image plane, in pixels\nVIS-B-DIST : distance to object in channel B, in mm\nVIS-C-AREA : area of dominant visible object for channel C, in pixels\nVIS-C-X : X location of object in channel C on image plane, -140 ... 140\nVIS-C-Y : Y location of channel C on image plane\nVIS-C-H : height of object in C on image plane, in pixels\nVIS-C-W : width of object in C on image plane, in pixels\nVIS-C-DIST : distance to object in channel C, in mm\n\nFor the visual variables, when there is no visible object, width = 0, height = 0, area = 0, distance = 10000.0, Y = 0, X = 140.0.

Position and orientation were defined to 14-bit accuracy, giving position information with a typical positional error less than one centimetre and angle error less than one half of a degree.

Due to resolution and occlusion, missing values are common.", "Data_Set_Information": "A Vicon motion capture camera system was used to record 12 users performing 5 hand postures with markers attached to a left-handed glove.\n\nA rigid pattern of markers on the back of the glove was used to establish a local coordinate system for the hand, and 11 other markers were attached to the thumb and fingers of the glove. 3 markers were attached to the thumb with one above the thumbnail and the other two on the knuckles. 2 markers were attached to each finger with one above the fingernail and the other on the joint between the proximal and middle phalanx.\n\nThe 11 markers not part of the rigid pattern were unlabeled; their positions were not explicitly tracked. Consequently, there is no a priori correspondence between the markers of two given records. In addition, due to the resolution of the capture volume and self-occlusion due to the orientation and configuration of the hand and fingers, many records have missing markers. Extraneous markers were also possible due to artifacts in the Vicon software's marker reconstruction/recording process and other objects in the capture volume. As a result, the number of visible markers in a record varied considerably.\n\nThe data presented here is already partially preprocessed. First, all markers were transformed to the local coordinate system of the record containing them. Second, each transformed marker with a norm greater than 200 millimeters was pruned. Finally, any record that contained fewer than 3 markers was removed. The processed data has at most 12 markers per record and at least 3. For more information, see 'Attribute Information'.\n\nDue to the manner in which data was captured, it is likely that for a given record and user there exists a near duplicate record originating from the same user. We recommend therefore to evaluate classification algorithms on a leave-one-user-out basis wherein each user is iteratively left out from training and used as a test set. One then tests the generalization of the algorithm to new users. A 'User' attribute is provided to accomodate this strategy.\n\nThis dataset may be used for a variety of tasks, the most obvious of which is posture recognition via classification. One may also attempt user identification. Alternatively, one may perform clustering (constrained or unconstrained) to discover marker distributions either as an attempt to predict marker identities or obtain statistical descriptions/visualizations of the postures.\n\nIn previous work, we randomly sampled without replacement a constant number (e.g. 75) of records per class per user in order to balance classes.", "Area": "Computer", "Number_of_Instances": "78095", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Multivariate", "Name": "Motion Capture Hand Postures Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Motion+Capture+Hand+Postures", "Attribute_Information": "Data is provided as a CSV file.

Data combines socio-economic data from the '90 Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 Law Enforcement Management and Admin Stats survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR", "Data_Set_Information": "The source datasets needed to be combined via programming. Many variables are included so that algorithms that select or learn weights for attributes could be tested. However, clearly unrelated attributes were not included; attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime (N=125), plus the crime variables which are potential dependent variables. The variables included in the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units. The crime attributes (N=18) that could be predicted are the 8 crimes considered 'Index Crimes' by the FBI)(Murders, Rape, Robbery, .... ), per capita (actually per 100,000 population) versions of each, and Per Capita Violent Crimes and Per Capita Nonviolent Crimes).\n\nA limitation was that the LEMAS survey was of the police departments with at least 100 officers, plus a random sample of smaller departments. For our purposes, communities not found in both census and crime datasets were omitted. Many communities are missing LEMAS data.\n\nThe per capita crimes variables were calculated using population values included in the 1995 FBI data (which differ from the 1990 Census values).\n\nThe per capita violent crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape, which resulted in missing values for per capita violent crime. Many of these omitted communities were from the midwestern USA (Minnesota, Illinois, and Michigan have many of these).\n\nThe per capita nonviolent crime variable was calculated using the sum of crime variables considered non-violent crimes in the United States: burglaries, larcenies, auto thefts and arsons. (There are many other types of crimes, these only include FBI 'Index Crimes')\n\nSome further pre-processing of the dataset must be done. Choose the desirable dependent variable from among the 18 possible. It would not be interesting or appropriate to predict total crime (e.g. violent crime) while including subtotals (e.g. murders) as independent variables. There are also identifying variables (community name, county code, community code) that are not predictive, and would get in the way of some algorithms. Weka's Unsupervised Attribute Remove Filter can be used to remove unwanted attributes.\n\nThe FBI notes that use of this data to evaluate communities is over-simplistic, as many relevant factors are not included.

contains 13910 measurements from 16 chemical sensors utilized in simulations for drift compensation in a discrimination task of 6 gases at various levels of concentrations. The goal is to achieve good performance (or as low degradation as possible) over time, as reported in the paper mentioned below in Section 2: Data collection. The primary purpose of providing this dataset is to make it freely accessible on-line to the chemo-sensor research community and artificial intelligence to develop strategies to cope with sensor/concept drift. The dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded.\nThe dataset was gathered within January 2007 to February 2011 (36 months) in a gas delivery platform facility situated at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. Being completely operated by a fully computerized environment \u00e2\u20ac\u201dcontrolled by a LabVIEW\u00e2\u20ac\u201cNational Instruments software on a PC fitted with the appropriate serial data acquisition boards. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner, minimizing thereby the common mistakes caused by human intervention and making it possible to exclusively concentrate on the chemical sensors for compensating real drift.\nThe resulting dataset comprises recordings from six distinct pure gaseous substances, namely Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Ethylene, Ethanol, and Toluene, each dosed at a wide variety of concentration values ranging from 5 to 1000 ppmv. See Tables 1 and 2 of the below cited manuscript for details on the gas identity name, concentration values, and time distribution sequence of the measurement recordings considered in this dataset.\n\nBatch10.dat was updated on 10/14/2013 to correct some corrupted values in the last 120 lines of the file.\n\nAn extension of this dataset with the concentration values is available at Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset at Different Concentrations Data Set [Web Link]", "Area": "Computer", "Number_of_Instances": "13910", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Multivariate", "Name": "Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+Sensor+Array+Drift+Dataset", "Attribute_Information": "The response of the said sensors is read-out in the form of the resistance across the active layer of each sensor; hence each measurement produced a 16-channel time series, each of which represented by an aggregate of features reflecting all the dynamic processes occurring at the sensor surface in reaction to the chemical substance being evaluated. In particular, two distinct types of features were considered in the creation of this dataset: (i) The so-called steady-state feature (\u00ce\u201dR), defined as the difference of the maximal resistance change and the baseline and its normalized version expressed by the ratio of the maximal resistance and the baseline values when the chemical vapor is present in the test chamber. And (ii), an aggregate of features reflecting the sensor dynamics of the increasing/decaying transient portion of the sensor response during the entire measurement procedure under controlled conditions, namely the exponential moving average (ema\u00ce\u00b1). These aggregate of features is a transform, borrowed from the field of econometrics originally introduced to the chemo-sensing community by Muezzinoglu et al. (2009), that converts the said transient portion into a real scalar, by estimating the maximum value \u00e2\u20ac\u201dminimum for the decaying portion of the sensor response\u00e2\u20ac\u201d of its exponential moving average (ema\u00ce\u00b1), with an initial condition set to zero and a scalar smoothing parameter of the operator, \u00ce\u00b1, that defines both the quality of the feature and the time of its occurrence along the time series the scalar, set to range between 0 and 1. In particular, three different values for \u00ce\u00b1 were set to obtain three different feature values from the pre-recorded rising portion of the sensor response and three additional features with the same \u00ce\u00b1 values but for the decaying portion of the sensor response, covering thus the entire sensor response dynamics. For a more detailed analysis and discussion on these features as well as a graphical illustration of them please refer to Section 2.3 and Figure 2, respectively of the annotated manuscript.\nOnce the abovementioned features are calculated, one is to form a feature vector containing the 8 features extracted from each particular sensor multiplied by the 16 sensors considered here. In the end, the resulting 128-dimensional feature vector containing all the features indicated above (8 features \u00c3\u2014 16 sensors) is organized as follows:\n\u00ce\u201dR_1, |\u00ce\u201dR|_1, EMAi0.001_1, EMAi0.01_1, EMAi0.1_1, EMAd0.001_1, EMAd0.01_1, EMAd0.1_1, \u00ce\u201dR_2, |\u00ce\u201dR|_2, EMAi0.001_2, EMAi0.01_2, EMAi0.1_2, EMAd0.001_2, EMAd0.01_2, EMAd0.1_2,..., \u00ce\u201dR_16, |\u00ce\u201dR|_16, EMAi0.001_16, EMAi0.01_16, EMAi0.1_16, EMAd0.001_16, EMAd0.01_16, EMAd0.1_16,\n\nwhere: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00ce\u201dR_1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153|\u00ce\u201dR|_1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is the \u00ce\u201dR and the normalized \u00ce\u201dR feature, respectively, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAi0.001_1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAi0.01_1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAi0.1_1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, the ema\u00ce\u00b1 of the rising transient portion of the sensor response for \u00ce\u00b1 equals to 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAd0.001_1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAd0.01_1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAd0.1_1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, the ema\u00ce\u00b1 of the decaying transient portion of the sensor response for \u00ce\u00b1 equals to 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively, all corresponding to sensor # 1; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00ce\u201dR_2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153|\u00ce\u201dR|_2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is the \u00ce\u201dR and the normalized \u00ce\u201dR feature, respectively, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAi0.001_2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAi0.01_2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAi0.1_2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, the ema\u00ce\u00b1 of the rising transient portion of the sensor response for \u00ce\u00b1 equals to 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAd0.001_2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAd0.01_2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAd0.1_2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, the ema\u00ce\u00b1 of the decaying transient portion of the sensor response for \u00ce\u00b1 equals to 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively, all corresponding to sensor # 2; and so forth up until sensor # 16, forming thus the 128-dimensional feature vector that is to be fetched to the classifiers for training.\nFor processing purposes, the data is organized into ten batches, each containing the number of measurements per class and month indicated in the table below. This reorganization of data was done to ensure having a sufficient and as uniformly distributed as possible number of experiments in each class and month when training the classifier.\n\nDataset organization details.

For example, in\n\n1 1:15596.162100 2:1.868245 3:2.371604 4:2.803678 5:7.512213 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 128:-2.654529\n\nThe number \u00e2\u20ac\u01531\u00e2\u20ac\u009d stands for the class number (in this case Ethanol), whereas the remaining 128 columns list the actual feature values for each measurement recording organized as described above.\nFinally, to make the results presented in the associated article reproducible for the reader, please use the following parameter values in the training task:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 folds: 10\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 log2c = -5, 10, 1\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 log2g = -10, 5, 1\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Scale the features in the training set appropriately to lie between -1 and +1.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 And use the following cross validation parameters:\n\nBatch C Gamma (\u00c9\u00a4) Rate\n1 256.0 0.03125 98.8764\n2 64.0 0.00390625 99.7588\n3 128.0 0.03125 100.0\n4 1.0 0.25 100.0\n5 2.0 0.015625 99.4924\n6 256.0 0.0009765625 99.5217\n7 64.0 0.0625 99.9723\n8 1024.0 0.0078125 99.6599\n9 2.0 0.00390625 100.0"}, {"Attribute_Characteristics": "N/A", "Source": "Original Owner and Donor\n\nGio Wiederhold\nStanford University\n650-725-8363\ngio '@' cs.stanford.edu", "Number_of_Web_Hits": "118481", "Relevant_Papers": "N/A", "Number_of_Attributes": "N/A", "Associated_Tasks": "N/A", "Date_Donated": "1999-07-07", "Missing_Values": "Yes", "Abstract": "Abstract: This data set contains a list of over 10000 films including many older, odd, and cult films.

The central file (MAIN) is a list of movies, each with a unique identifier. These identifiers may change in successive versions. The actors (CAST) for those movies are listed with their roles in a distinct file. More information about individual actors (ACTORS) is in a third file. All directors in MAIN are listed in a fourth file (PEOPLE), with a number of important producers, writers, and cinematographers. A fifth file (REMAKES) links movies that were copied to a substantial extent from each other. The sixth file (STUDIOS) provides some information about studios shown in MAIN.\n\nThe original motivation was for database class exercises, to replace the boring `manager of the toy-department' queries. Note that the CASTS, refering MAIN and ACTORS is logically identical to the inventory file refering to suppliers and assemblies in the the standard bill-of-materials problems. Personal interests caused the database to be made complete for all Hitchcock movies and TV episodes. Related films by type and actor were added gradually.\n\nSubsequent research on temporal databases caused date fields (years only) to be added. It allows testing, say, if the dates-of-work of an ACTOR match the dates of the MAIN films that the CAST relation shows. Object-oriented database features could be tested with fields having multiple and two-level values, as documented in DOC.\n\nThe entries were gradually collected during course work starting about 1975 and are still being updated. Most of the entries were manual. The DOC file lists some of the reference works used. Corrections and additions continue to be appreciated.\n\nDetailed descriptions of the fields and their formats is provided in doc.html.\n\nMissing Values:\n\nOutside of key fields, missing values are common. Their encoding is described in DOC. Sometimes the data seems to be unavailable, sometimes it hasn't been entered. Some information, as `lived-with' is inherently incomplete.\n\nCensored Data:\n\nMinor actors are ignored.\n\nDependencies:\n\nEvery MAIN film must have a director in PEOPLE. About 50 pseudo director names ahve been listed in PEOPLE to allow interesting films to with (yet) unknown directors to be entered. Every CASTS entry must relate to a MAIN film entry. Every ACTOR should appear in some CASTS entry, but not vice versa. See DOC for more type information.\n\nOther Relevant Information:\n\nFilms are listed, if known, with their original language title.

The acquired time series of the sensors are provided.\n\nThe experimental setup was designed to test gas sensors in realistic environments. Traditionally, chemical detection systems based on chemo-resistive sensors include a gas chamber to control the sample air flow and minimize turbulence. Instead, we utilized a wind tunnel with two independent gas sources that generate two gas plumes. The plumes get naturally mixed along a turbulent flow and reproduce the gas concentration fluctuations observed in natural environments. Hence, the gas sensors can capture the spatio-temporal information contained in the gas plumes.\n\na) Chemical detection platform:\nThe chemical detection platform was composed of 8 MOX gas sensors that generate a time-dependent multivariate response to the different gas stimuli. The utilized sensors were made commercially available by Figaro (TGS2611, TGS2612, TGS2610, TGS2600, TGS2602 TGS2620). The operating temperature of the sensors was controlled by the built-in heater, which was kept at a constant voltage of 5V. The detection platform also includes Temperature and Relative Humidity sensors. The generated sensors' responses were acquired at a sampling rate of 20 ms for the whole duration of the experiment.\n\nb) Wind tunnel:\nIn order to generate two independent gas plumes in an open environment, we built a 2.5 m x 1.2 m x 0.4 m wind tunnel facility with two gas sources (labeled as source1 and source2). Each source was controlled independently to release the selected volatiles at different flow rates, which generated different concentration levels in the sensors' position. The wind generator created a turbulent flow that constantly displaced the introduced volatiles towards the exhaust outlet.\n\nc) Experimental protocol:\nWe exposed the detection unit to mixtures of Ethylene with Methane or Carbon Monoxide. The mixtures were originated releasing Ethylene at source1 and releasing Methane / Carbon Monoxide at source2.\n\nEach volatile was released at four different flows (zero z, low l, medium m, and high h), providing up to 30 different mixture configurations: 15 mixtures of Ethylene with CO (h+h, h+m, h+l, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6, z+h, z+m, z+l) and 15 mixtures of Ethylene with Methane. Each configuration was repeated 6 times. Hence, the complete dataset was composed of 180 measurements, which were performed in a random order.\n\nBy means of a GCMS system, the mean concentration levels at the sensors' location were estimated: Ethylene (l: 31 ppm, m: 46 ppm, h: 96 ppm), CO (l: 270 ppm, m: 397 ppm, h: 460 ppm), Methane (l: 51 ppm, m: 115 ppm, h: 131 ppm). It is worth noting that GC-MS systems only provide the mean value of the concentration and are not sensitive to concentration fluctuations.\n\nEach measurement, which had a total duration of 300 seconds, was performed as follows: Initially no gas was released and clean air flowed along the wind tunnel. 60 seconds after, both sources started to release the corresponding volatile at the specified flow rate. The duration of the gas release was 180 s. Finally, the system acquired the recovery to the baseline for another 60 s.", "Area": "Computer", "Number_of_Instances": "180", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Multivariate, Time-Series", "Name": "Gas sensor array exposed to turbulent gas mixtures Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+array+exposed+to+turbulent+gas+mixtures", "Attribute_Information": "The dataset is presented in 180 text files, where each file corresponds to a different measurement.

The TAO array consists of nearly 70 moored buoys spanning the equatorial Pacific, measuring oceanographic and surface meteorological variables critical for improved detection, understanding and prediction of seasonal-to-interannual climate variations originating in the tropics, most notably those related to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles.\n\nThe moorings were developed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL). Each mooring measures air temperature, relative humidity, surface winds, sea surface temperatures and subsurface temperatures down to a depth of 500 meters and a few a of the buoys measure currents, rainfall and solar radiation. The data from the array, and current updates, can be viewed on the web at the this address .\n\nThe El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle of 1982-1983, the strongest of the century, created many problems throughout the world. Parts of the world such as Peru and the Unites States experienced destructive flooding from increased rainfalls while the western Pacific areas experienced drought and devastating brush fires. The ENSO cycle was neither predicted nor detected until it was near its peak. This highlighted the need for an ocean observing system (i.e. the TAO array) to support studies of large scale ocean-atmosphere interactions on seasonal-to-interannual time scales.\n\nThe TAO array provides real-time data to climate researchers, weather prediction centers and scientists around the world. Forcasts for tropical Pacific Ocean temperatures for one to two years in advance can be made using the ENSO cycle data. These forcasts are possible because of the moored buoys, along with drifting buoys, volunteer ship temperature probes, and sea level measurements.\n\nResearch questions of interest include:\n\n- How can the data be used to predict weather conditions throughout the world?\n- How do the variables relate to each other?\n- Which variables have a greater effect on the climate variations?\n- Does the amount of movement of the buoy effect the reliability of the data?\n- When performing an analysis of the data, one should pay attention the possible affect of autocorrelation. Using a multiple regression approach to model the data would require a look at autoregression since the weather statistics of the previous days will affect today's weather.\n\nThe data is stored in an ASCII files with one observation per line.

Other data that was taken in various locations are rainfall, solar radiation, current levels, and subsurface temperatures.\n\nThe latitude and longitude in the data showed that the bouys moved around to different locations. The latitude values stayed within a degree from the approximate location. Yet the longitude values were sometimes as far as five degrees off of the approximate location.\n\nLooking at the wind data, both the zonal and meridional winds fluctuated between -10 m/s and 10 m/s. The plot of the two wind variables showed no linear relationship. Also, the plots of each wind variable against the other three meteorolgical data showed no linear relationships.\n\nThe relative humidity values in the tropical Pacific were typically between 70% and 90%.\n\nBoth the air temperature and the sea surface temperature fluctuated between 20 and 30 degrees Celcius. The plot of the two temperatures variables shows a positive linear relationship existing. The two temperatures when each plotted against time also have similar plot designs. Plots of the other meteorological variables against the temperature variables showed no linear relationship.\n\nThere are missing values in the data.

They performed a protocol of activities composed of six basic activities: three static postures (standing, sitting, lying) and three dynamic activities (walking, walking downstairs and walking upstairs). The experiment also included postural transitions that occurred between the static postures. These are: stand-to-sit, sit-to-stand, sit-to-lie, lie-to-sit, stand-to-lie, and lie-to-stand. All the participants were wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist during the experiment execution. We captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz using the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of the device. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.\n\nThe sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of 561 features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.\n\nThis dataset is an updated version of the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using smartphones Dataset that can be found at: [Web Link]\nThis version provides the original raw inertial signals from the smartphone sensors, instead of the ones pre-processed into windows which were provided in version 1.

We have taken the position of each country's capital city (or the province of the area) by latitude and longitude as the absolute point of origin.\n\nThe program MARSYAS[1] was used to extract audio features from the wave files. We used the default MARSYAS settings in single vector format (68 features) to estimate the performance with basic timbal information covering the entire length of each track. No feature weighting or pre-filtering was applied. All features were transformed to have a mean of 0, and a standard deviation of 1. We also investigated the utility of adding chromatic attributes. These describe the notes of the scale being used. This is especially important as a distinguishing feature in geographical ethnomusicology. The chromatic features provided by MARSYAS are 12 per octave - Western tuning, but it may be possible to tell something from how similar to or different from Western tuning the music is.\n\n[1] G.

It is a multilabel dataset with three columns of labels. This dataset was created segmenting 60 audio records belonging to 4 different families, 8 genus, and 10 species. Each audio corresponds to one specimen (an individual frog), the record ID is also included as an extra column. We used the spectral entropy and a binary cluster method to detect audio frames belonging to each syllable. The segmentation and feature extraction were carried out in Matlab. After the segmentation we got 7195 syllables, which became instances for train and test the classifier. These records were collected in situ under real noise conditions (the background sound). Some species are from the campus of Federal University of Amazonas, Manaus, others from Mata Atl\u00c3\u00a2ntica, Brazil, and one of them from C\u00c3\u00b3rdoba, Argentina.

Due to resolution and occlusion, missing values are common.", "Data_Set_Information": "A Vicon motion capture camera system was used to record 12 users performing 5 hand postures with markers attached to a left-handed glove.\n\nA rigid pattern of markers on the back of the glove was used to establish a local coordinate system for the hand, and 11 other markers were attached to the thumb and fingers of the glove. 3 markers were attached to the thumb with one above the thumbnail and the other two on the knuckles. 2 markers were attached to each finger with one above the fingernail and the other on the joint between the proximal and middle phalanx.\n\nThe 11 markers not part of the rigid pattern were unlabeled; their positions were not explicitly tracked. Consequently, there is no a priori correspondence between the markers of two given records. In addition, due to the resolution of the capture volume and self-occlusion due to the orientation and configuration of the hand and fingers, many records have missing markers. Extraneous markers were also possible due to artifacts in the Vicon software's marker reconstruction/recording process and other objects in the capture volume. As a result, the number of visible markers in a record varied considerably.\n\nThe data presented here is already partially preprocessed. First, all markers were transformed to the local coordinate system of the record containing them. Second, each transformed marker with a norm greater than 200 millimeters was pruned. Finally, any record that contained fewer than 3 markers was removed. The processed data has at most 12 markers per record and at least 3. For more information, see 'Attribute Information'.\n\nDue to the manner in which data was captured, it is likely that for a given record and user there exists a near duplicate record originating from the same user. We recommend therefore to evaluate classification algorithms on a leave-one-user-out basis wherein each user is iteratively left out from training and used as a test set. One then tests the generalization of the algorithm to new users. A 'User' attribute is provided to accomodate this strategy.\n\nThis dataset may be used for a variety of tasks, the most obvious of which is posture recognition via classification. One may also attempt user identification. Alternatively, one may perform clustering (constrained or unconstrained) to discover marker distributions either as an attempt to predict marker identities or obtain statistical descriptions/visualizations of the postures.\n\nIn previous work, we randomly sampled without replacement a constant number (e.g. 75) of records per class per user in order to balance classes.", "Area": "Computer", "Number_of_Instances": "78095", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Multivariate", "Name": "MoCap Hand Postures Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MoCap+Hand+Postures", "Attribute_Information": "Data is provided as a CSV file.

The diseases in this group are psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, cronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Usually a biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis but unfortunately these diseases share many histopathological features as well. Another difficulty for the differential diagnosis is that a disease may show the features of another disease at the beginning stage and may have the characteristic features at the following stages. Patients were first evaluated clinically with 12 features. Afterwards, skin samples were taken for the evaluation of 22 histopathological features. The values of the histopathological features are determined by an analysis of the samples under a microscope.\n\nIn the dataset constructed for this domain, the family history feature has the value 1 if any of these diseases has been observed in the family, and 0 otherwise.

However, not all of these signals are equally valuable in a specific monitoring system. The measured signals contain a combination of useful information, irrelevant information as well as noise. It is often the case that useful information is buried in the latter two. Engineers typically have a much larger number of signals than are actually required. If we consider each type of signal as a feature, then feature selection may be applied to identify the most relevant signals. The Process Engineers may then use these signals to determine key factors contributing to yield excursions downstream in the process. This will enable an increase in process throughput, decreased time to learning and reduce the per unit production costs.\n\nTo enhance current business improvement techniques the application of feature selection as an intelligent systems technique is being investigated.\n\nThe dataset presented in this case represents a selection of such features where each example represents a single production entity with associated measured features and the labels represent a simple pass/fail yield for in house line testing, figure 2, and associated date time stamp. Where \u20131 corresponds to a pass and 1 corresponds to a fail and the data time stamp is for that specific test point.\n\n\nUsing feature selection techniques it is desired to rank features according to their impact on the overall yield for the product, causal relationships may also be considered with a view to identifying the key features.\n\nResults may be submitted in terms of feature relevance for predictability using error rates as our evaluation metrics. It is suggested that cross validation be applied to generate these results. Some baseline results are shown below for basic feature selection techniques using a simple kernel ridge classifier and 10 fold cross validation.\n\nBaseline Results: Pre-processing objects were applied to the dataset simply to standardize the data and remove the constant features and then a number of different feature selection objects selecting 40 highest ranked features were applied with a simple classifier to achieve some initial results. 10 fold cross validation was used and the balanced error rate (*BER) generated as our initial performance metric to help investigate this dataset.\n\n\nSECOM Dataset: 1567 examples 591 features, 104 fails\n\nFSmethod (40 features) BER % True + % True - %\nS2N (signal to noise) 34.5 +-2.6 57.8 +-5.3 73.1 +2.1\nTtest 33.7 +-2.1 59.6 +-4.7 73.0 +-1.8\nRelief 40.1 +-2.8 48.3 +-5.9 71.6 +-3.2\nPearson 34.1 +-2.0 57.4 +-4.3 74.4 +-4.9\nFtest 33.5 +-2.2 59.1 +-4.8 73.8 +-1.8\nGram Schmidt 35.6 +-2.4 51.2 +-11.8 77.5 +-2.3", "Area": "Computer", "Number_of_Instances": "1567", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Multivariate", "Name": "SECOM Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SECOM", "Attribute_Information": "Key facts: Data Structure: The data consists of 2 files the dataset file SECOM consisting of 1567 examples each with 591 features a 1567 x 591 matrix and a labels file containing the classifications and date time stamp for each example.\n\nAs with any real life data situations this data contains null values varying in intensity depending on the individuals features.

The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuarians call this process \"symboling\". A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.\n\nThe third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons, sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car per year.\n\nNote: Several of the attributes in the database could be used as a \"class\" attribute.", "Area": "N/A", "Number_of_Instances": "205", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Multivariate", "Name": "Automobile Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile", "Attribute_Information": "Attribute: Attribute Range\n\n1. symboling: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.\n2. normalized-losses: continuous from 65 to 256.\n3. make:\nalfa-romero, audi, bmw, chevrolet, dodge, honda,\nisuzu, jaguar, mazda, mercedes-benz, mercury,\nmitsubishi, nissan, peugot, plymouth, porsche,\nrenault, saab, subaru, toyota, volkswagen, volvo\n\n4. fuel-type: diesel, gas.\n5. aspiration: std, turbo.\n6. num-of-doors: four, two.\n7. body-style: hardtop, wagon, sedan, hatchback, convertible.\n8. drive-wheels: 4wd, fwd, rwd.\n9. engine-location: front, rear.\n10. wheel-base: continuous from 86.6 120.9.\n11. length: continuous from 141.1 to 208.1.\n12. width: continuous from 60.3 to 72.3.\n13. height: continuous from 47.8 to 59.8.\n14. curb-weight: continuous from 1488 to 4066.\n15. engine-type: dohc, dohcv, l, ohc, ohcf, ohcv, rotor.\n16. num-of-cylinders: eight, five, four, six, three, twelve, two.\n17. engine-size: continuous from 61 to 326.\n18. fuel-system: 1bbl, 2bbl, 4bbl, idi, mfi, mpfi, spdi, spfi.\n19. bore: continuous from 2.54 to 3.94.\n20. stroke: continuous from 2.07 to 4.17.\n21. compression-ratio: continuous from 7 to 23.\n22. horsepower: continuous from 48 to 288.\n23. peak-rpm: continuous from 4150 to 6600.\n24. city-mpg: continuous from 13 to 49.\n25. highway-mpg: continuous from 16 to 54.\n26. price: continuous from 5118 to 45400."}, {"Attribute_Characteristics": "Real", "Source": "Marques de S\u00c3\u00a1, J.P., jpmdesa '@' gmail.com, Biomedical Engineering Institute, Porto, Portugal.\nBernardes, J., joaobern '@' med.up.pt, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Portugal.\nAyres de Campos, D., sisporto '@' med.up.pt, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Portugal.", "Number_of_Web_Hits": "91150", "Relevant_Papers": "Ayres de Campos et al.

Classifying TV News commercials is a semantic video classification problem. TV News commercials on particular news channel are combinations of video shots uniquely characterized by audio-visual presentation. Hence various audio visual features extracted from video shots are widely used for TV commercial classification. Indian News channels do not follow any particular news presentation format, have large variability and dynamic nature presenting a challenging machine learning problem.

Broadcast News videos are segmented into video shots using RGB Colour Histogram matching Between consecutive video frames. From each video shot we have extracted 7 Audio ( viz. Short term energy, zero crossing rate, Spectral Centroid, spectral Flux, spectral Roll off frequency, fundamental frequency and MFCC Bag of Audio Words) and 5 visual Features ( viz. Video shot length, Screen Text Distribution, Motion Distribution, Frame Difference Distribution, Edge Change Ratio) from each video shot. Details of each extracted feature are as follows.\nAudio Features :-\nIn general to attract viewer's attention TV commercials have higher audio amplitude, appropriate background music ( comparatively higher frequencies) as well as sharp transitions from one music to other or music to speech etc. We try to capture these properties by using low level audio features -- Short Time Energy (STE) , Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), Spectral Centroid, Spectral Flux, Spectral Roll-Off Frequency and Fundamental Frequency. All of these short term audio features are calculated with audio frame size of 20 msec at 8000Hz sampling Frequency. The Mean and standard deviation of all audio feature values are calculated over the shot, generating a 2D vector for each feature.\nThe MFCC Bag of Audio Words have been successfully used in several existing speech/audio processing applications. This motivated us to compute the MFCC coefficients along with Delta and Delta-Delta Cepstrum from 150 hours of audio tracks. These coefficients are clustered into 4000 groups which form the Audio words. Each shot is then represented as a 4000 Dimensional Bag of Audio Words by forming the normalized histograms of the MFCC's extracted from 20 ms windows with overlap of 10 ms in the shots.\n\nVideo Features :\nCommercial video shots are usually short in length, fast visual transitions with peculiar placement of overlaid text bands. Video Shot Length is directly used as one of the feature. Placement of overlaid text bands is represented by 15 dimensional overlaid Text Distribution. To calculate Text Distribution feature, video frame is divided into a grid of size 5 X 3( 15 grid blocks). The text distribution feature is obtained by averaging the fraction of text area present in a grid block over all frames of the shot. Motion Distribution, Frame Change Distribution and Edge Change Ratio captures the dynamic nature of the commercial shots.\nMotion Distribution is obtained by first computing dense optical flow (Horn-Schunk formulation) followed by construction of a distribution of flow magnitudes over the entire shot with 40 uniformly divided bins in range of [0, 40]. Sudden changes in pixel intensities are grasped by Frame Difference Distribution. Such changes are not registered by optical flow. Thus, Frame Difference Distribution is also computed along with flow magnitude distributions. We obtain the frame difference by averaging absolute frame difference in each of 3 color channels and the distribution is constructed with 32 bins in the range of [0, 255] . Edge Change Ratio Captures the motion of edges between consecutive frames and is defined as ratio of displaced edge pixels to the total number of edge pixels in a frame. We calculate the mean and variance of the ECR over the entire shot.\n\n\nThe Feature File is represented in Lib SVM data format and contains approximetly 63% commercial instances( Positives).

Magnetic field-based methods are becoming an important trend in this research field. Here, we present UJIIndoorLoc-Mag database, which can be used to compare magnetic field-based indoor localization methods. It consists of 270 continuous samples for training and 11 for testing.

Position information is calculated on the basis of ultrasound emissions from emitters the glove to a 3-microphone \"L-Bar\" that sits atop a monitor. There are two emitters on the glove; and three receivers. This allows the calculation of 4 pieces of information: x (left/right), y (up/down), z (backward/forward), and roll (is the palm pointing up or down?). x, y and z are measured with 8 bit accuracy. \"x, y, z\" should not be taken to be the normal 3-dimensional orthogonal basis. In particular, 1 unit in the z direction is not of similar distance to 1 unit in the x or y directions. These x, y, z positions are relative to a calibration point which is when the palm is resting on the seated signer's thigh. Roll is 4 bits.\n\nThe data is susceptible to occasional \"spikes\" caused by random ultrasound noise. Median filters have been found to be beneficial in solving this problem.\n\nFinger bend is generated by conductive bend sensors on the first four fingers. Values vary between 0 (straight) and 3 (fully bent). Accuracy is 2 bits. The gloves automatically apply a hysteresis filter on these bend sensors. At best, these measurements should be treated sceptically.\n\nSee past usage for a more detailed discussion on the data collection methodology.\n\nThe data was collected from five signers:\n\nSigner -- Description -- Sessions -- Total samples/sign\n\nAdam -- Sign linguist - PhD completed in area. -- 2 -- 8\nAndrew -- Natural signer - signing since youth -- 3 -- 8\nJohn -- Professional Auslan interpreter -- 5 -- 18\nStephen -- Professional Auslan interpreter -- 4 -- 16\nWaleed -- The researcher.

Data come from two of longwalls located in a Polish coal mine.", "Data_Set_Information": "Mining activity was and is always connected with the occurrence of dangers which are commonly called\nmining hazards. A special case of such threat is a seismic hazard which frequently occurs in many\nunderground mines. Seismic hazard is the hardest detectable and predictable of natural hazards and in\nthis respect it is comparable to an earthquake. More and more advanced seismic and seismoacoustic\nmonitoring systems allow a better understanding rock mass processes and definition of seismic hazard\nprediction methods. Accuracy of so far created methods is however far from perfect. Complexity of\nseismic processes and big disproportion between the number of low-energy seismic events and the number\nof high-energy phenomena (e.g. > 10^4J) causes the statistical techniques to be insufficient to predict\nseismic hazard. Therefore, it is essential to search for new opportunities of better hazard prediction,\nalso using machine learning methods. In seismic hazard assessment data clustering techniques can be\napplied (Lesniak A., Isakow Z.: Space-time clustering of seismic events and hazard assessment in the\nZabrze-Bielszowice coal mine, Poland. Int. Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences, 46(5), 2009,\n918-928), and for prediction of seismic tremors artificial neural networks are used (Kabiesz, J.: Effect\nof the form of data on the quality of mine tremors hazard forecasting using neural networks.\nGeotechnical and Geological Engineering, 24(5), 2005, 1131-1147). In the majority of applications, the\nresults obtained by mentioned methods are reported in the form of two states which are interpreted as\n'hazardous' and 'non-hazardous'. Unbalanced distribution of positive ('hazardous state') and negative\n('non-hazardous state') examples is a serious problem in seismic hazard prediction. Currently used\nmethods are still insufficient to achieve good sensitivity and specificity of predictions. In the paper\n(Bukowska M.: The probability of rockburst occurrence in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin area dependent on\nnatural mining conditions. Journal of Mining Sciences, 42(6), 2006, 570-577) a number of factors having\nan effect on seismic hazard occurrence was proposed, among other factors, the occurrence of tremors with\nenergy > 10^4J was listed. The task of seismic prediction can be defined in different ways, but the main\naim of all seismic hazard assessment methods is to predict (with given precision relating to time and\ndate) of increased seismic activity which can cause a rockburst. In the data set each row contains a\nsummary statement about seismic activity in the rock mass within one shift (8 hours). If decision\nattribute has the value 1, then in the next shift any seismic bump with an energy higher than 10^4 J was\nregistered. That task of hazards prediction bases on the relationship between the energy of recorded\ntremors and seismoacoustic activity with the possibility of rockburst occurrence. Hence, such hazard\nprognosis is not connected with accurate rockburst prediction. Moreover, with the information about the\npossibility of hazardous situation occurrence, an appropriate supervision service can reduce a risk of\nrockburst (e.g. by distressing shooting) or withdraw workers from the threatened area. Good prediction\nof increased seismic activity is therefore a matter of great practical importance. The presented data\nset is characterized by unbalanced distribution of positive and negative examples.

The sensors were exposed to different gaseous binary mixtures of acetone and ethanol.", "Data_Set_Information": "The measured data was collected using a chemical sensing system based on an array of 16 metal-oxide gas sensors and an external mechanical ventilator to simulate the biological respiration cycle. The tested gas classes (12 in total) formed a relatively broad combination of two analytes, acetone and ethanol, in binary mixtures. Both, raw data set and feature data set, are available. In particular, two sets of low-frequency and high-frequency features are provided for a comparison study.\n\nThe primary data analysis is supposed to be a multivariate regression with multiple responses (two responses), where the predictors were the features extracted from the sensor signals and the responses were the concentrations of two analytes, acetone and ethanol. This task is also known as a mixture quantification problem of two analytes. Please see the article (Ziyatdinov et al., 2014, Section 3.2) for such regression analysis based on partial least squares (PLS). A classification task is also possible given that a small number of samples per class is available, if all the 12 classes are used. Another classification problem can be stated to distinguish two pure analytes and mixtures of them.\n\nThree concentrations doses 0.1, 0.3 and 1 vol.% were used to prepare the dilutions in water for the pure analytes. The same dilutions were used to generate gas mixtures. The gas classes included samples of pure ethanol ('lab' attribute eth-0.1, eth-0.3 and eth-1), samples of pure acetone (ace-0.1, ace-0.3 and ace-1), samples of binary mixtures of ethanol and acetone (ace-0.1-eth-0.1, ace-0.1-eth-0.3, ace-0.3-eth-0.1, ace-0.1-eth-1 and ace-1-eth-0.1) and samples of water dilutions without any analyte (air) giving a total number of 12 classes. The choice of these analytes and concentrations was not affected by any particular application constraint, except that the sensors of selected models show consistent and diverse responses among the gas classes. The statistics on class distribution among 58 samples:\n\neth-0.1: 6\neth-0.3: 4\neth-1: 5\nace-0.1: 6\nace-0.3: 6\nace-1: 3\nace-0.1-eth-0.1: 4\nace-0.1-eth-0.3: 5\nace-0.3-eth-0.1: 5\nace-0.1-eth-1: 3\nace-1-eth-0.1: 3\nair: 8\n\nThe measurements were split into 5 batches ('batch' attribute), where each batch contained records approximately for all gas classes given in a random order. All the batches were collected in a time period of 4 days to minimize the effect of the long-term internal and environmental noise in the system. The statistics on batch distribution among 58 samples:\n\nday-1-morning: 19\nday-2-afternoon: 10\nday-2-morning: 10\nday-3-morning: 11\nday-4-afternoon: 8\n\nThe array was composed of 16 metal-oxide gas sensors of 5 different TGS models from Figaro Inc. The sensors were configured for 10 different sensor conditioning profiles based on the combination of 5 TGS models and 2 sensor operating temperatures. The circuit board with the gas sensor array was placed in a 70 ml inner volume chamber connected to the mechanical ventilator. The device of the mechanical ventilator was made commercially available from Harvard Apparatus (Harvard Apparatus, Harvard Inspira Advanced Safety Ventilator Manual, Tech. rep., 2003). The mechanical ventilator includes a cylinder of volume 63.44 cm3 and a mechanical pump that takes air from the outlet 'Source' and pushes the air sample through the outlet 'To Animal'. The system also receives the sample again in the outlet 'From Animal' to close the loop, control the air pressure decay, and collect the exhaled air. The cylinder of the ventilator was fixed to a frequency of 5 breaths per minute, approximately equivalent to 0.08 Hz for all the measurements. See the article (Ziyatdinov et al., 2014, Section 2.1) for a detailed description of the experimental set up.\n\nThe measurement protocol was the following: using a micropipette we delivered 10 \u00ce\u00bcl of the corresponding dilution to the vessel, which in turn was connected to the apparatus 'Source' channel to expose the sensor array to the generated gas sample. After 3 min of exposition, the source of the gas vapour was removed from the vessel to start the recovery phase. During the recovery phase, the system was sampling room air for 2 additional minutes to record the decay in the sensors signals. The recorded time-series signal for each sensor was acquired at the sampling frequency of 25 Hz during 5 min, resulting in 7500 data points per time-series of a single sensor. Note that 2 minutes of recovery phase was not sufficient to recover the sensors baseline and re-establish again the initial conditions in the gas chamber. Hence, although we acquired 2 minutes of recovery phase, the system was pumping air until the sensors recovered the baseline and the whole gas sample was exhausted from the gas chamber.\n\nThe readout data was the output voltage of the sensor stored as resistance values according to the voltage-divider scheme and using the value of the load resistor. Hence, each data point in the array described the resistance of a sensor R(t) at a certain time of measurement t. The resistance\nvalues in the data set were normalized by subtracting the baseline value R0 = R(t0) at the\nstarting point of the measurement t0 and scaling by factor R0, (R(t) \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 R0)/R0. Note that such format of the measured raw data allows for comparison of responses among different sensors.\n\nPreviously to computing the low-frequency and high-frequency features, the raw data were pre-processed by a set of digital filters. A median filter was used to remove the spikes in the signals. Then we employed two Butterworth filters of 3rd order: a low-pass filter (cut-off frequency 0.01 Hz) and a high-pass filter (pass-frequency 0.07 Hz) to generate the low/high frequency signals, respectively. Note that these low/high frequency signals (output of the two Butterworth filters) are not distributed within the data set.\n\nFor feature extraction, both low-frequency and high-frequency sensor signals were divided by respiratory cycles, where each cycle was processed independently. Thus, a feature is referred to as a feature by respiratory cycle. Since high-frequency signals showed oscillatory behavior similar to a sine wave curve, we decided to follow a straightforward strategy for feature extraction in this case. We used amplitude of the high-frequency signal (oscillation) at every respiratory cycle as a feature. Low-frequency trajectories had a monotonic behaviour, and we used the magnitude of the low-frequency signal as a feature at every respiratory cycle. The magnitude value was taken at the same time of oscillation, where the amplitude of the high-frequency signal was measured. Note that the low-frequency and high-frequency features were computed only for the first 13 respiration cycles.\n\nIn addition to the low/high frequency features, we also introduced a cycle-independent feature per\nsingle measurement, defined as the maximum of the low-frequency signal over the course of\nthe measurement.\n\nThe first data analysis of the data set was presented in (Ziyatdinov et al., 2014), and the results reported there should be considered as a reference. The study aimed to characterize and explore the sensor signals in response to the modulated gas flow at a fixed respiration frequency. It was expected to confirm a superior performance of the proposed system under the gas flow modulation on the early detection scenario. The acquired modulated signals were decomposed into low-frequency and high-frequency components, and the resulted feature sets were compared in terms of the discrimination performance. Note that it was assumed that the low-frequency part of the modulated signals approximate the signals that would be measured under the standard constant flow rate mode (such assumption was empirically confirmed by observing the transient dynamics).\n\nThe strategy in signal- and data-processing applied in (Ziyatdinov et al., 2014) was straightforward, and the analysis can be improved in a number of ways, on the stages of feature extraction and/or pattern recognition. Hence, the raw data stored in 'rawdata.csv.gz' file is intended for testing feature extraction methods, while the features computed in (Ziyatdinov et al., 2014) and stored in 'features.csv' can be readily used in testing pattern recognition methods.\n\nAdditional links:\n1.

Therefore, automatic user localization has been a hot research topic in the last years. Automatic user localization consists of estimating the position of the user (latitude, longitude and altitude) by using an electronic device, usually a mobile phone. Outdoor localization problem can be solved very accurately thanks to the inclusion of GPS sensors into the mobile devices. However, indoor localization is still an open problem mainly due to the loss of GPS signal in indoor environments. Although, there are some indoor positioning technologies and methodologies, this database is focused on WLAN fingerprint-based ones (also know as WiFi Fingerprinting).\n\nAlthough there are many papers in the literature trying to solve the indoor localization problem using a WLAN fingerprint-based method, there still exists one important drawback in this field which is the lack of a common database for comparison purposes. So, UJIIndoorLoc database is presented to overcome this gap. We expect that the proposed database will become the reference database to compare different indoor localization methodologies based on WiFi fingerprinting.\n\nThe UJIIndoorLoc database covers three buildings of Universitat Jaume I with 4 or more floors and almost 110.000m2. It can be used for classification, e.g. actual building and floor identification, or regression, e.g. actual longitude and latitude estimation. It was created in 2013 by means of more than 20 different users and 25 Android devices. The database consists of 19937 training/reference records (trainingData.csv file) and 1111 validation/test records (validationData.csv file).\n\nThe 529 attributes contain the WiFi fingerprint, the coordinates where it was taken, and other useful information.\n\nEach WiFi fingerprint can be characterized by the detected Wireless Access Points (WAPs) and the corresponding Received Signal Strength Intensity (RSSI). The intensity values are represented as negative integer values ranging -104dBm (extremely poor signal) to 0dbM. The positive value 100 is used to denote when a WAP was not detected. During the database creation, 520 different WAPs were detected. Thus, the WiFi fingerprint is composed by 520 intensity values.\n\nThen the coordinates (latitude, longitude, floor) and Building ID are provided as the attributes to be predicted.\n\nAdditional information has been provided.\n\nThe particular space (offices, labs, etc.) and the relative position (inside/outside the space) where the capture was taken have been recorded.

This database derives from a subset of the higher quality LRS observations taken between 12h and 24h right ascension.\n\nThis database contains 531 high quality spectra derived from the IRAS-LRS database. The original data contained 100 spectral measurements in each of two overlapping bands. Of these, 44 blue band and 49 red band channels contain usable flux measurements. Only these are included here. The original spectral intensities values are compressed to 4-digits, and each spectrum includes 5 rescaling parameters. We have used the LRS specified algorithm to rescale these to units of spectral intensity (Janskys). Total intensity differences have been eliminated by normalizing each spectrum to a mean value of 5000.\n\nThis database was originally obtained for use in development and testing of our AutoClass system for Bayesian classification. We have not retained any results from this development, having concentrated our efforts of a 5425 element version of the same data. Our classifications were based upon simultaneous modeling of all 93 spectral intensities. With the larger database we were able to find classes that correspond well with known spectral types associated with particular stellar types. We also found classes that match with the spectra expected of certain stellar processes under investigation by Ames astronomers. These classes have considerably enlarged the set of stars being investigated by those researchers.\n\nOriginal Data:\n\nThe original fortran data file is given in spectra-2.data.

However, clearly unrelated attributes were not included; attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime (N=122), plus the attribute to be predicted (Per Capita Violent Crimes). The variables included in the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units.\n\nThe per capita violent crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape, which resulted in incorrect values for per capita violent crime. These cities are not included in the dataset. Many of these omitted communities were from the midwestern USA.\n\nData is described below based on original values. All numeric data was normalized into the decimal range 0.00-1.00 using an Unsupervised, equal-interval binning method. Attributes retain their distribution and skew (hence for example the population attribute has a mean value of 0.06 because most communities are small). E.g. An attribute described as 'mean people per household' is actually the normalized (0-1) version of that value.\n\nThe normalization preserves rough ratios of values WITHIN an attribute (e.g. double the value for double the population within the available precision - except for extreme values (all values more than 3 SD above the mean are normalized to 1.00; all values more than 3 SD below the mean are nromalized to 0.00)).\n\nHowever, the normalization does not preserve relationships between values BETWEEN attributes (e.g. it would not be meaningful to compare the value for whitePerCap with the value for blackPerCap for a community)\n\nA limitation was that the LEMAS survey was of the police departments with at least 100 officers, plus a random sample of smaller departments. For our purposes, communities not found in both census and crime datasets were omitted.

For each mixture, signals were acquired continuously during 12 hours.", "Data_Set_Information": "This data set contains the acquired time series from 16 chemical sensors exposed to gas mixtures at varying concentration levels. In particular, we generated two gas mixtures: Ethylene and Methane in air, and Ethylene and CO in air. Each measurement was constructed by the continuous acquisition of the 16-sensor array signals for a duration of about 12 hours without interruption.\n\nThe data set was collected in a gas delivery platform facility at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner.\n\nThe sensor array included 16 chemical sensors (Figaro Inc., US) of 4 different types: TGS-2600, TGS-2602, TGS-2610, TGS-2620 (4 units of each type). The sensors were integrated with customized signal conditioning and control electronics. The operating voltage of the sensors, which controls the sensors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 operating temperature, was kept constant at 5 V for the whole duration of the experiments. The sensors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conductivities were acquired continuously at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. The sensor array was placed in a 60 ml measurement chamber, where the gas sample was injected at a constant flow of 300 ml/min.\n\nEach measurement was constructed by the continuous acquisition of the 16-sensor array signals while concentration levels changed randomly. For each measurement (each gas mixture), the signals were acquired continuously for about 12 hours without interruption.\n\nThe concentration transitions were set at random times (in the interval 80-120s) and to random concentration levels. The data set was constructed such that all possible transitions are present: increasing, decreasing, or setting to zero the concentration of one volatile while the concentration of the other volatile is kept constant (either at a fixed or at zero concentration level). At the beginning, ending, and approximately every 10,000 s, we inserted additional predefined concentration patterns with pure gas mixtures.\n\nThe concentration ranges for Ethylene, Methane, and CO were selected such that the induced magnitudes of the sensor responses were similar. Moreover, for gas mixtures, lower concentration levels were favored. Therefore, the multivariate response of the sensors to the presented set of stimuli is challenging since none of the configurations (single\ngas or mixture presentation) can be easily identified from the magnitude of sensors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 responses. In particular Ethylene concentration ranges from 0-20 ppm; 0-600 ppm for CO; and 0-300 ppm for Methane.\n\nThe primary purpose of making this data set freely accessible on-line is to provide extensive and continuous time series acquired from chemical sensors to the sensor and artificial intelligence research communities to develop and test strategies to solve a wide variety of tasks. In particular, the data set may be useful to develop algorithms for continuous monitoring or improve response time of sensory systems. Also, the repetition of the same type of sensors in the array will allow further investigation on sensor variability (reproducibility of sensors of the same kind). Other interesting topics may include sensor failure (to what extent system predictions degrade when sensors start failing) or calibration transfer (whether the model for one sensor can be extended to other sensors).\n\nMore information on the generated data set can be found in Fonollosa et al.

Each cylinder is itself described by 9 attributes: location x 3, axis x 3, height, radius, and texture. This code generates instances in one of four classes: dogs, cats, horses, and giraffes. The program generates instances by selecting a class according to a distribution determined by function rand4().

The task is intended as real-life benchmark in the area of Ambient Assisted Living.", "Data_Set_Information": "This dataset represents a real-life benchmark in the area of Ambient Assisted Living applications, as described in [1].\nThe binary classification task consists in predicting the pattern of user movements in real-world office environments from time-series generated by a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN).\nInput data contains temporal streams of radio signal strength (RSS) measured between the nodes of a WSN, comprising 5 sensors: 4 anchors deployed in the environment and 1 mote worn by the user. Data has been collected during user movements at the frequency of 8 Hz (8 samples per second). In the provided dataset, the RSS signals have been rescaled to the interval [-1,1], singly on the set of traces collected from each anchor (as in [1]).\nTarget data consists in a class label indicating whether the user's trajectory will lead to a change in the spatial context (i.e. a room change) or not. In particular, the target class +1 is associated to the location changing movements, while the target class -1 is associated to the location preserving movements.\nThe measurement campaign involved a number of 3 different environmental settings, each of which comprises 2 rooms (containing typical office furniture) separated by a corridor. A sketch of the common setup considered is provided in the attached Figure. In each environmental setting, the anchors are deployed in fixed positions near the rooms corners (at the height of 1.5 m from the ground), while the mobile is worn on the chest of the user. The Figure also shows a simplified illustration of the types of user trajectories considered, with straight paths yielding to a spatial context change and curved ones leading to spatial context preservation. Each path produces a trace of RSS measurements from the beginning of the trajectory until a marker point, which is denoted as M in the Figure. The marker M is the same for all the movements, therefore different paths cannot be distinguished based only on the RSS values collected at M.\n\nEach input file in the provided dataset contains data pertaining to one temporal sequence of input RSS data (1 user trajectory for each file). The dataset contains 314 sequences, for a total number of 13197 steps.\n\nFurther information can be found at the webpage: [Web Link].\nA complete description of this dataset can be found in [1], which also provides details on the performance achieved by Echo State Networks on the corresponding classification task.", "Area": "Computer", "Number_of_Instances": "13197", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Multivariate, Sequential, Time-Series", "Name": "Indoor User Movement Prediction from RSS data Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Indoor+User+Movement+Prediction+from+RSS+data", "Attribute_Information": "Data is provided in comma separated value (csv) format.\n\n- Input data\nInput RSS streams are provided in files named MovementAAL_RSS_SEQID.csv, where IDSEQ is the progressive numeric sequence ID.\nIn each file, each row corresponds to a time step measurement (in temporal order) and contains the following information:\nRSS_anchor1, RSS_anchor2, RSS_anchor3, RSS_anchor4\n\n- Target data\nTarget data is provided in the file MovementAAL_target.csv\nEach row in this file contains:\nsequence_ID, class_label\n\n\n- Dataset grouping\nData is grouped in 3 sets, as described in [1].\nFile MovementAAL_DatasetGroup.csv, provides information about such data grouping.\nEach row in this file contains:\nsequence_ID, dataset_ID\n\n- Path grouping\nUsers' movements are divided in 6 prototypical paths, as described in [1].\nFile MovementAAL_Paths.csv provides information about data grouping based on path type.\nEach row in this file contains:\nsequence_ID, path_ID"}, {"Attribute_Characteristics": "Real", "Source": "Byron Roe (byronroe '@' umich.edu)\nDepartment of Physics University of Michigan\nAnn Arbor, MI 48109", "Number_of_Web_Hits": "35598", "Relevant_Papers": "B.

The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153online\u00e2\u20ac\u009d process involves capturing of data as text is written on a digitizing tablet with an electronic pen.", "Data_Set_Information": "A dataset of online handwritten assamese characters by collecting samples from 45 writers is created. Each writer contributed 52 basic characters, 10 numerals and 121 assamese conjunct consonants. The total number of entries corresponding to each writer is 183 (= 52 characters + 10 numerals + 121 conjunct consonants). The total number of samples in the dataset is 8235 ( = 45 \u00c3\u2014 183 ).\n\nThe handwriting samples were collected on an iball 8060U external digitizing tablet connected to a laptop using its cordless digital stylus pen. The data acquisition program consists of a GUI which shows a box on the screen along with other controls. The writers are instructed to write only inside the acquisition box. The acquisition program records the handwriting as a stream of (X, Y) coordinate points using the appropriate pen position sensor along with the pen-up/pen-down switching. No pressure level was recorded.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset consists of 45 folders (one for each writer) and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Data_Table.pdf\u00e2\u20ac\u009d file. This file contains information about the character id (ID), character name (Label) and actual shape of the character (Char).\n\nEach folder contains 183 text files corresponding to the 183 characters written by a single writer. Each file is named based on the pair (M, N). The text file \u00e2\u20ac\u0153M.N.txt\u00e2\u20ac\u009d represents the character with ID \u00e2\u20ac\u0153M\u00e2\u20ac\u009d written by the writer with ID \u00e2\u20ac\u0153N\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.

Sensors placed on the subject's chest, right wrist and left ankle are used to measure the motion experienced by diverse body parts, namely, acceleration, rate of turn and magnetic field orientation. The sensor positioned on the chest also provides 2-lead ECG measurements, which can be potentially used for basic heart monitoring, checking for various arrhythmias or looking at the effects of exercise on the ECG.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDATASET SUMMARY:\n#Activities: 12\n#Sensor devices: 3\n#Subjects: 10\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nThe collected dataset comprises body motion and vital signs recordings for ten volunteers of diverse profile while performing 12 physical activities (Table 1). Shimmer2 [BUR10] wearable sensors were used for the recordings. The sensors were respectively placed on the subject's chest, right wrist and left ankle and attached by using elastic straps (as shown in the figure in attachment). The use of multiple sensors permits us to measure the motion experienced by diverse body parts, namely, the acceleration, the rate of turn and the magnetic field orientation, thus better capturing the body dynamics. The sensor positioned on the chest also provides 2-lead ECG measurements which are not used for the development of the recognition model but rather collected for future work purposes. This information can be used, for example, for basic heart monitoring, checking for various arrhythmias or looking at the effects of exercise on the ECG. All sensing modalities are recorded at a sampling rate of 50 Hz, which is considered sufficient for capturing human activity. Each session was recorded using a video camera. This dataset is found to generalize to common activities of the daily living, given the diversity of body parts involved in each one (e.g., frontal elevation of arms vs. knees bending), the intensity of the actions (e.g., cycling vs. sitting and relaxing) and their execution speed or dynamicity (e.g., running vs. standing still). The activities were collected in an out-of-lab environment with no constraints on the way these must be executed, with the exception that the subject should try their best when executing them.\n\nACTIVITY SET\nThe activity set is listed in the following:\nL1: Standing still (1 min)\nL2: Sitting and relaxing (1 min)\nL3: Lying down (1 min)\nL4: Walking (1 min)\nL5: Climbing stairs (1 min)\nL6: Waist bends forward (20x)\nL7: Frontal elevation of arms (20x)\nL8: Knees bending (crouching) (20x)\nL9: Cycling (1 min)\nL10: Jogging (1 min)\nL11: Running (1 min)\nL12: Jump front & back (20x)\nNOTE: In brackets are the number of repetitions (Nx) or the duration of the exercises (min).\n\nA complete and illustrated description (including table of activities, sensor setup, etc.) of the dataset is provided in the papers presented in the section \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Citation Requests\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.", "Area": "Computer", "Number_of_Instances": "120", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Multivariate, Time-Series", "Name": "MHEALTH Dataset Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MHEALTH+Dataset", "Attribute_Information": "The data collected for each subject is stored in a different log file: 'mHealth_subject.log'.

The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.\n\nHISTORY:\n\nThis data was originally gathered at the TI in 1986-87 by JP Siebert. It was partially financed by Barr and Stroud Ltd. The original purpose was to find a method of distinguishing 3D objects within a 2D image by application of an ensemble of shape feature extractors to the 2D silhouettes of the objects. Measures of shape features extracted from example silhouettes of objects to be discriminated were used to generate a classification rule tree by means of computer induction.\n\nThis object recognition strategy was successfully used to discriminate between silhouettes of model cars, vans and buses viewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation.\n\nThe rule tree classification performance compared favourably to MDC (Minimum Distance Classifier) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbour) statistical classifiers in terms of both error rate and computational efficiency. An investigation of these rule trees generated by example indicated that the tree structure was heavily influenced by the orientation of the objects, and grouped similar object views into single decisions.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThe features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS (Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS, which extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising both classical moments based measures such as scaled variance, skewness and kurtosis about the major/minor axes and heuristic measures such as hollows, circularity, rectangularity and compactness.\n\nFour \"Corgie\" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400. This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.\n\nThe images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the model vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation (34.2 degrees to the horizontal). The vehicles were placed on a diffuse backlit surface (lightbox). The vehicles were painted matte black to minimise highlights. The images were captured using a CRS4000 framestore connected to a vax 750. All images were captured with a spatial resolution of 128x128 pixels quantised to 64 greylevels. These images were thresholded to produce binary vehicle silhouettes, negated (to comply with the processing requirements of BINATTS) and thereafter subjected to shrink-expand-expand-shrink HIPS modules to remove \"salt and pepper\" image noise.\n\nThe vehicles were rotated and their angle of orientation was measured using a radial graticule beneath the vehicle. 0 and 180 degrees corresponded to \"head on\" and \"rear\" views respectively while 90 and 270 corresponded to profiles in opposite directions. Two sets of 60 images, each set covering a full 360 degree rotation, were captured for each vehicle. The vehicle was rotated by a fixed angle between images. These datasets are known as e2 and e3 respectively.\n\nA further two sets of images, e4 and e5, were captured with the camera at elevations of 37.5 degs and 30.8 degs respectively. These sets also contain 60 images per vehicle apart from e4.van which contains only 46 owing to the difficulty of containing the van in the image at some orientations.", "Area": "N/A", "Number_of_Instances": "946", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Multivariate", "Name": "Statlog (Vehicle Silhouettes) Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28Vehicle+Silhouettes%29", "Attribute_Information": "ATTRIBUTES\n\nCOMPACTNESS (average perim)**2/area\n\nCIRCULARITY (average radius)**2/area\n\nDISTANCE CIRCULARITY area/(av.distance from border)**2\n\nRADIUS RATIO (max.rad-min.rad)/av.radius\n\nPR.AXIS ASPECT RATIO (minor axis)/(major axis)\n\nMAX.LENGTH ASPECT RATIO (length perp. max length)/(max length)\n\nSCATTER RATIO (inertia about minor axis)/(inertia about major axis)\n\nELONGATEDNESS area/(shrink width)**2\n\nPR.AXIS RECTANGULARITY area/(pr.axis length*pr.axis width)\n\nMAX.LENGTH RECTANGULARITY area/(max.length*length perp. to this)\n\nSCALED VARIANCE (2nd order moment about minor axis)/area\nALONG MAJOR AXIS\n\nSCALED VARIANCE (2nd order moment about major axis)/area\nALONG MINOR AXIS\n\nSCALED RADIUS OF GYRATION (mavar+mivar)/area\n\nSKEWNESS ABOUT (3rd order moment about major axis)/sigma_min**3\nMAJOR AXIS\n\nSKEWNESS ABOUT (3rd order moment about minor axis)/sigma_maj**3\nMINOR AXIS\n\nKURTOSIS ABOUT (4th order moment about major axis)/sigma_min**4\nMINOR AXIS\n\nKURTOSIS ABOUT (4th order moment about minor axis)/sigma_maj**4\nMAJOR AXIS\n\nHOLLOWS RATIO (area of hollows)/(area of bounding polygon)\n\nWhere sigma_maj**2 is the variance along the major axis and sigma_min**2 is the variance along the minor axis, and\n\narea of hollows= area of bounding poly-area of object\n\nThe area of the bounding polygon is found as a side result of the computation to find the maximum length.

Recently, process delays known as cylinder banding in rotogravure printing were substantially mitigated using control rules discovered by decision tree induction. Our work exemplifies a more general methodology which transforms the knowledge acquisition task from one in which rules are directly elicited from an expert, to one in which a learning system is responsible for rule generation.

(2009), that converts the transient portion of the sensor response into a real scalar by estimating the maximum/minimum value y[k] for the rising/decaying portion of the exponential moving average of the sensor response:\n\ny[k] = (1-Alfa) y[k-1]+Alfa(R[k]-R[k-1])\n\nwhere R[k] is the sensor resistance measured at time k and Alfa is a scalar smoothing parameter between 0 and 1.\n\nIn particular, three different values for Alfa=0.1, 0.01, 0.001 were set to obtain three different feature values from the rising portion of the sensor response and three additional features with the same Alfa values for the decaying portion of the sensor response, covering thus the entire sensor response dynamics.\n\nThus, each feature vector contains the 8 features extracted from each particular sensor, resulting in a 128-dimensional feature vector (8 features x 16 sensors) containing all the features and organized as follows:\nDR_1, |DR|_1, EMAi0.001_1, EMAi0.01_1, EMAi0.1_1, EMAd0.001_1, EMAd0.01_1, EMAd0.1_1, DR_2, |DR|_2, EMAi0.001_2, EMAi0.01_2, EMAi0.1_2, EMAd0.001_2, EMAd0.01_2, EMAd0.1_2,..., DR_16, |DR|_16, EMAi0.001_16, EMAi0.01_16, EMAi0.1_16, EMAd0.001_16, EMAd0.01_16, EMAd0.1_16\nwhere: DR_j and |DR|_j are the R and the normalized R features, respectively. EMAi0.001_j, EMAi0.01_j, and EMAi0.1_j, are the emaR of the rising transient portion of the sensor response for Alfa 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively. EMAd0.001_j, EMAd0.01_j, and EMAd0.1_j, are emaR of the decaying transient portion of the sensor response for Alfa 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively. The index j=1\u00e2\u20ac\u00a616 represents the number of the sensor, forming thus the 128-dimensional feature vector.\n\nFor processing purposes, the dataset is organized into ten batches, each containing the number of measurements per class and month indicated in the tables below. This reorganization of data was done to ensure having a sufficient and as uniformly distributed as possible number of experiments in each batch.\n\nBatch ID Month IDs\nBatch 1 Months 1 and 2\nBatch 2 Months 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10\nBatch 3 Months 11, 12, and 13\nBatch 4 Months 14 and 15\nBatch 5 Month 16\nBatch 6 Months 17, 18, 19, and 20\nBatch 7 Month 21\nBatch 8 Months 22 and 23\nBatch 9 Months 24 and 30\nBatch 10 Month 36\n\nBatch ID: Ethanol, Ethylene, Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Toluene\nBatch 1: 83, 30, 70, 98, 90, 74\nBatch 2: 100, 109, 532, 334, 164, 5\nBatch 3: 216, 240, 275, 490, 365, 0\nBatch 4: 12, 30, 12, 43, 64, 0\nBatch 5: 20, 46, 63, 40, 28, 0\nBatch 6: 110, 29, 606, 574, 514, 467\nBatch 7: 360, 744, 630, 662, 649, 568\nBatch 8: 40, 33, 143, 30, 30, 18\nBatch 9: 100, 75, 78, 55, 61, 101\nBatch 10: 600, 600, 600, 600, 600, 600\n\n\nThe dataset is organized in files, each representing a different batch. Within the files, each line represents a measurement. The first character (1-6) codes the analyte, followed by the concentration level:\n\n1: Ethanol; 2: Ethylene; 3: Ammonia; 4: Acetaldehyde; 5: Acetone; 6: Toluene\n\nThe data format follows the same coding style as in libsvm format x:v, where x stands for the feature number and v for the actual value of the feature. For example, in\n1;10.000000 1:15596.162100 2:1.868245 3:2.371604 4:2.803678 5:7.512213 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 128:-2.654529\n\nThe number 1 stands for the class number (in this case Ethanol), the gas concentration level was 10ppmv, and the remaining 128 columns list the actual feature values for each measurement recording organized as described above."}, {"Attribute_Characteristics": "Categorical, Integer, Real", "Source": "Creators:\n\n1.

Protocol:\nSeven male and three female subjects (age 25 to 30), who have experienced aggression in scenarios such\nas physical fighting, took part in the experiment. Throughout 20 individual experiments, each subject\nhad to perform ten normal and ten aggressive activities. Regarding the rights of the subjects involved,\nethical regulations have been followed based on the code of ethics of the British psychological society,\nwhich explains the ethical legislations to conduct statistical experiments using human subjects. For safety\nprecaution issues, boxing hand wraps have been given to the subjects, and for the warm up the subjects\nwere instructed to familiarise with the bag by having a number of trial runs. The subjects were aware that\nsince their involvement in this series of experiments was voluntary, it was made clear that they could\nwithdraw at any time from the study.\n\n2. Instrumentation:\nThe Essex robotic arena was the main experimental hall where the data collection took place. With area\n4x5.5m, the ten subjects expressed normal and aggressive physical activities at random locations. For the\nnormal actions, a human partner has been used as a focus target attracting the attention from the subjects\nso as to perform more realistic activity. For the aggressive actions, the subjects made use of a professional\nkick-boxing standing bag, 1.75m tall, with a human figure drawn on its body. The bag has cylindrical shape\nmade from soft material, which could bounce when hit. All the activities have been recorded from random\nstarting positions so that to have a variety of spatial 3D data.

Data Setup:\nEach experimental trial has been taken separately for each physical activity. The duration of each action\nwas approximately ~10 seconds per subject, which corresponds to a time series of ~3000 samples, with\nsampling frequency of 200Hz.

The samples written by 30 writers are used for training, cross-validation and writer dependent testing, and the digits written by the other 14 are used for writer independent testing. This database is also available in the UNIPEN format.\n\nWe use a WACOM PL-100V pressure sensitive tablet with an integrated LCD display and a cordless stylus. The input and display areas are located in the same place. Attached to the serial port of an Intel 486 based PC, it allows us to collect handwriting samples. The tablet sends $x$ and $y$ tablet coordinates and pressure level values of the pen at fixed time intervals (sampling rate) of 100 miliseconds.\n\nThese writers are asked to write 250 digits in random order inside boxes of 500 by 500 tablet pixel resolution. Subject are monitored only during the first entry screens. Each screen contains five boxes with the digits to be written displayed above. Subjects are told to write only inside these boxes. If they make a mistake or are unhappy with their writing, they are instructed to clear the content of a box by using an on-screen button. The first ten digits are ignored because most writers are not familiar with this type of input devices, but subjects are not aware of this.\n\nIn our study, we use only ($x, y$) coordinate information. The stylus pressure level values are ignored. First we apply normalization to make our representation invariant to translations and scale distortions. The raw data that we capture from the tablet consist of integer values between 0 and 500 (tablet input box resolution). The new coordinates are such that the coordinate which has the maximum range varies between 0 and 100. Usually $x$ stays in this range, since most characters are taller than they are wide.\n\nIn order to train and test our classifiers, we need to represent digits as constant length feature vectors. A commonly used technique leading to good results is resampling the ( x_t, y_t) points. Temporal resampling (points regularly spaced in time) or spatial resampling (points regularly spaced in arc length) can be used here. Raw point data are already regularly spaced in time but the distance between them is variable. Previous research showed that spatial resampling to obtain a constant number of regularly spaced points on the trajectory yields much better performance, because it provides a better alignment between points. Our resampling algorithm uses simple linear interpolation between pairs of points. The resampled digits are represented as a sequence of T points ( x_t, y_t )_{t=1}^T, regularly spaced in arc length, as opposed to the input sequence, which is regularly spaced in time.\n\nSo, the input vector size is 2*T, two times the number of points resampled. We considered spatial resampling to T=8,12,16 points in our experiments and found that T=8 gave the best trade-off between accuracy and complexity.", "Area": "Computer", "Number_of_Instances": "10992", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Multivariate", "Name": "Pen-Based Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pen-Based+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits", "Attribute_Information": "All input attributes are integers in the range 0..100.\nThe last attribute is the class code 0..9"}, {"Attribute_Characteristics": "Real", "Source": "Luis Candanedo, luismiguel.candanedoibarra '@' umons.ac.be, University of Mons (UMONS).", "Number_of_Web_Hits": "20814", "Relevant_Papers": "Luis M.

In each situation (e.g. preparing sandwich), a large number of action primitives occur (e.g. reach for bread, move to bread cutter, operate bread cutter).\n\n* ADL run *\n\nThe ADL run consists of temporally unfolding situations:\n\nStart: lying on the deckchair, get up\nGroom: move in the room, check that all the objects are in the right places in the drawers and on shelves\nRelax: go outside and have a walk around the building\nPrepare coffee: prepare a coffee with milk and sugar using the coffee machine\nDrink coffee: take coffee sips, move around in the environment\nPrepare sandwich: include bread, cheese and salami, using the bread cutter and various knifes and plates\nEat sandwich\nCleanup: put objects used to original place or dish washer, cleanup the table\nBreak: lie on the deckchair\n\n* Drill run *\n\nThe drill run consists of 20 repetitions of the following sequence of activities:\n\nOpen then close the fridge\nOpen then close the dishwasher\nOpen then close 3 drawers (at different heights)\nOpen then close door 1\nOpen then close door 2\nToggle the lights on then off\nClean the table\nDrink while standing\nDrink while seated\n\n** Annotations **\n\nThe annotations are done on five \u00c2\u2018tracks\u00c2\u2019. One track contains modes of locomotion (e.g. sitting, standing, walking). Two other tracks indicate the actions of the left and right hand (e.g. reach, grasp, release), and to which object they apply (e.g. milk, switch, door).\nThe fourth track indicates the high level activities (e.g. prepare sandwich). The high level activities relate to the situations indicated in the description of the ADL runs as follows (in parenthesis the number of the situations indicated above): relaxing (1, 9), early morning (2, 3), coffee time (4, 5), sandwich time (6, 7), cleanup (8).\n\nThe mid-level gesture annotations is generated automatically from the low-level hand actions. It comprises coarser characterization of the user's activities. For instance the low-level annotations 'reach door' and 'open door' are combined into a single 'open door' mid-level annotation. Here, the mid-level annotations comprise actions of the left and right hand indiscriminately. However, in practice, the users mostly interacted with the environment with their right hand. We recommend to use the mid-level annotations in first attempts to use this dataset.\n\n** Applications **\n\nThis dataset offers a rich playground to assess methods such as, e.g:\n\n* Classification, (semi-) supervised machine learning\n* Automatic segmentation\n* Unsupervised structure discovery\n* Data imputation\n* Multi-modal sensor fusion\n* Sensor network research\n* Transfer learning, multitask learning\n* Sensor selection\n* Feature extraction\n* Classifier calibration and adaptation\n* ...\n\n** Baseline benchmarks **\n\nBaseline benchmarks for the OPPORTUNITY Activity Recognition Challenge subset of the dataset are available in reference [2].

Three types of recordings (Static Spiral Test, Dynamic Spiral Test and Stability Test) are taken.", "Data_Set_Information": "The PD and control handwriting database consists of 62 PWP (People with parkinson) and 15 healthy individuals who appealed at the Department of Neurology in Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. From all subjects, three types of handwriting recordings (Static Spiral Test (SST), Dynamic Spiral Test (DST) and Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP)) are taken. Also the drawings of spirals belongs to the PWP are included in the dataset as image. Therefore, this dataset can also be used for regression.\n\nHandwriting dataset was constructed using Wacom Cintiq 12WX graphics (Hahne et al., 2009) table. It is basically a graphics tablet and LCD monitor rolled into one. It enables to display a PC's screen on its monitor and only interacts with digitized pens. Special software was designed for recording handwriting drawings and testing the coordination of the PD patients using the recordings. The software uses API functions of the device and was developed in C# platform which can be run on Windows systems You can contact with the authors to request the software which is mentioned [1].\n\nIn this study, there are three different kinds of tests developed for the data collection via graphics tablet. The first one isthe Static Spiral Test (SST) which is frequently used for clinical research in the literature for different purposes like determining motor performance (Wang et al., 2008), measuring tremor (Pullman, 1998) and diagnosing PD (Saunders et al., 2008). In this test, three wound Archimedean spirals appears on the graphics tablet using the software and patients were asked to retrace the same spiral as much as they can using the digital pen. During the test, the features which are mentioned above and the other data to specify the patient are recorded to the database.\n\nThe second test is the Dynamic Spiral Test (DST). Unlike SST, Archimedean spiral just appears and disappears in certain time intervals, in other words the Archimedean spiral blinks. This forces the patient to keep the pattern in mind and continue to draw. The purpose of this test is to determine the change in patient's drawing performance and pause times since it is more difficult to retrace the Archimedean spiral in this case. As a result of this test, it is observed that most of the patients continued drawing but nearly all of them lost the pattern.\n\nThe third test is Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP). In this test, there is a certain red point in the middle of the screen and the subjects are asked to hold the digital pen on the point without touching the screen in a certain time. The purpose of this test is to determine the patient's hand stability or hand tremor level.\n\nFurther details are contained in the following reference -- if you use this dataset, please cite:\n\n1.Isenkul, M.E.; Sakar, B.E.; Kursun, O. .

The aim is to predict this classification, given the multi-spectral values. In the sample database, the class of a pixel is coded as a number.\n\nThe Landsat satellite data is one of the many sources of information available for a scene. The interpretation of a scene by integrating spatial data of diverse types and resolutions including multispectral and radar data, maps indicating topography, land use etc. is expected to assume significant importance with the onset of an era characterised by integrative approaches to remote sensing (for example, NASA's Earth Observing System commencing this decade). Existing statistical methods are ill-equipped for handling such diverse data types. Note that this is not true for Landsat MSS data considered in isolation (as in this sample database). This data satisfies the important requirements of being numerical and at a single resolution, and standard maximum-likelihood classification performs very well. Consequently, for this data, it should be interesting to compare the performance of other methods against the statistical approach.\n\nOne frame of Landsat MSS imagery consists of four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands. Two of these are in the visible region (corresponding approximately to green and red regions of the visible spectrum) and two are in the (near) infra-red. Each pixel is a 8-bit binary word, with 0 corresponding to black and 255 to white. The spatial resolution of a pixel is about 80m x 80m. Each image contains 2340 x 3380 such pixels.\n\nThe database is a (tiny) sub-area of a scene, consisting of 82 x 100 pixels. Each line of data corresponds to a 3x3 square neighbourhood of pixels completely contained within the 82x100 sub-area. Each line contains the pixel values in the four spectral bands (converted to ASCII) of each of the 9 pixels in the 3x3 neighbourhood and a number indicating the classification label of the central pixel. The number is a code for the following classes:\n\nNumber Class\n1 red soil\n2 cotton crop\n3 grey soil\n4 damp grey soil\n5 soil with vegetation stubble\n6 mixture class (all types present)\n7 very damp grey soil\n\nNB. There are no examples with class 6 in this dataset.\n\nThe data is given in random order and certain lines of data have been removed so you cannot reconstruct the original image from this dataset.\n\nIn each line of data the four spectral values for the top-left pixel are given first followed by the four spectral values for the top-middle pixel and then those for the top-right pixel, and so on with the pixels read out in sequence left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Thus, the four spectral values for the central pixel are given by attributes 17,18,19 and 20. If you like you can use only these four attributes, while ignoring the others.

This dataset was already used in the experiments described in Freitas et al. (2014).\n\nThe dataset is composed by eighteen videos recorded using Microsoft Kinect sensor. In each video, a user performs (five times), in front of the sensor, five sentences in Libras (Brazilian Sign Language) that require the use of a grammatical facial expression.

Pulsars are a type of star, of considerable scientific interest. Candidates must be classified in to pulsar and non-pulsar classes to aid discovery.", "Data_Set_Information": "HTRU2 is a data set which describes a sample of pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey (South) [1].\n\nPulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter (see [2] for more uses).\n\nAs pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, and when this crosses our line of sight, produces a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. As pulsars\nrotate rapidly, this pattern repeats periodically. Thus pulsar search involves looking for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes.\n\nEach pulsar produces a slightly different emission pattern, which varies slightly with each rotation (see [2] for an introduction to pulsar astrophysics to find out why). Thus a potential signal detection known as a 'candidate', is averaged over many rotations of the pulsar, as determined by the length of an observation. In the absence of additional info, each candidate could potentially describe a real pulsar. However in practice almost all detections are caused by radio frequency interference (RFI) and noise, making legitimate signals hard to find.\n\nMachine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted,\n(see [4,5,6,7,8,9]) which treat the candidate data sets as binary classification problems. Here the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class, and spurious examples the majority negative class. At present multi-class labels are unavailable, given the costs associated with data annotation.\n\nThe data set shared here contains 16,259 spurious examples caused by RFI/noise, and 1,639 real pulsar examples. These examples have all been checked by human annotators.\n\nThe data is presented in two formats: CSV and ARFF (used by the WEKA data mining tool). Candidates are stored in both files in separate rows. Each row lists the variables first, and the class label is the final entry. The class labels used are 0 (negative) and 1 (positive).\n\nPlease note that the data contains no positional information or other astronomical details. It is simply feature data extracted from candidate files using the PulsarFeatureLab tool (see [10]).", "Area": "Physical", "Number_of_Instances": "17898", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Multivariate", "Name": "HTRU2 Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2", "Attribute_Information": "Each candidate is described by 8 continuous variables, and a single class variable.

Two samples have been collected for each pair writer/character, so the total number of samples in this database version is 1364:\n\n11 writers x 2 repetitions x (2x26 letters + 10 digits)\n\nThe proposed task is a writer-independent one consisting of 11 leaving-one-writer-out tests, so the effective training set size (for each one of the 1364 test samples) is 1240:\n\n10 writers x 2 repetitions x (2x26 letters + 10 digits)\n\nMoreover, this classification task is a 35-class one because we have not considered a different class for each different character: each one of the 26 letters is considered as a case-independent class, there are 9 additional clases for non-zero digits, and the zero is included in the same class as o's.\n\nThis database is available in a UNIPEN-like format, trying to mimic the original Pendigits database.

Each one of the 11 writers completed 2 non-consecutive sessions. In each session, the corresponding writer was asked to write one exemplar for each character in a fixed set including lowercase letters, uppercase ones, and digits, along with other characters omitted from this database version. The acquisition program shows a set of boxes on the screen, a different one for each required character, and writers are told to write only inside those boxes. If they make a mistake or are unhappy with a character writing, they are instructed to clear the content of the corresponding box by using an on-screen button and try again. Subjects are monitored only when writing their first exemplars and every sample considered OK by its writer was accepted as such.\n\nOnly X and Y coordinate information was recorded along the strokes by the acquisition program, without, for instance, pressure level values or timing information. Thus, in multi-stroke samples, no information at all was recorded between strokes; however, in this database version we have included a \".DT 100\" line in sample files after each stroke, following the Pendigits database criterion.\n\nWe have observed that runs of consecutive points with identical coordinates were frequently acquired inside strokes; such runs were preserved in this database version, so each database user must decide whether to avoid them by an appropriate preprocessing step or not.", "Area": "Computer", "Number_of_Instances": "1364", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Multivariate, Sequential", "Name": "UJI Pen Characters Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/UJI+Pen+Characters", "Attribute_Information": "For each sample, you can find:\n\na.

Our primary purpose is to make our dataset freely accessible on-line to the chemo-sensing research and machine-learning communities, as well as other interested communities, to develop alternative competitive solutions relevant to gas-sensing discrimination tasks in open sampling settings, such as the one pursued here, and/or navigation. The dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded.\nThe dataset was gathered from December 2010 to April 2012 (16 months) in a 2.5 m \u00c3\u2014 1.2 m \u00c3\u2014 0.4 m wind tunnel research test-bed facility situated at the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. Specifically, our customized research facility, endowed with a computer-supervised mass flow controller-based continuous flow gas delivery system, operates in a propulsion open-cycle mode, by continuously drawing external turbulent air into and throughout the tunnel and exhausting it back to the outside, thereby creating a relatively less-turbulent airflow moving downstream towards the end of the test field, which is particularly suitable for applications pursued here that require injecting chemical poisonous agents or explosive mixtures because it prevents saturation. Being operated by a fully computerized environment \u00e2\u20ac\u201dcontrolled by a player/stage robot server software programmed on C++ on a PC fitted with the appropriate serial cards\u00e2\u20ac\u201d and with minimum human intervention, the designed wind tunnel test-bed facility provides versatility for releasing the chemical substances of interest at the desired concentrations with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner during the entire experiment and simultaneously in preserving the appropriate environmental conditions to generate chemical gas plumes exhibiting turbulent patterns. A graphical illustration of the designed wind tunnel test-bed facility considered in this study along with the characteristics of the geometry of the problem as well as the exact locations of the chemical analyte source and chemo-sensory platform is presented in Figure 2 of the manuscript cited below. Actual pictures of the designed wind tunnel are also presented in the Supplementary Material, Figure S.1 of the accompanying manuscript.\nThe resulting dataset induces a ten-class gas discrimination problem, comprising recordings from ten distinct pure chemical gases, namely Acetone, Acetaldehyde, Ammonia, Butanol, Ethylene, Methane, Methanol, Carbon Monoxide, Benzene, and Toluene. The goal is to identify and discriminate the mentioned chemical hazards at relevant concentrations regardless of the location of the sensory system platform within the annotated wind tunnel research facility as well as the environmental and parametric conditions induced in the setting (Please see manuscript for more details). See Table 1 on Vergara et a. 2013 (manuscript below) for specifics on the identity of chemical analyte hazards as well as their nominal concentration values at the outlet of the gas source in parts-per-million by volume (ppmv). Please refer to the manuscript below for a more details of the wind tunnel test-bed facility as well as for specifics on the collection procedure followed and the operating and environmental parameters utilized during the creation of the aforementioned dataset.", "Area": "Computer", "Number_of_Instances": "18000", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Multivariate, Time-Series", "Name": "Gas sensor arrays in open sampling settings Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+arrays+in+open+sampling+settings", "Attribute_Information": "The response of the sensor platform is read-out in the form of the resistance across the active sensitive film of each of the 72 gas sensors integrating the sensor array; hence, each measurement produced a 72-channel time series, each of which represented by a 260-second time series collected at a sample rate of 100 samples per second (Hz), reflecting all the environmental changes in the evaluated scenario. For a more detailed analysis and discussion on the processing of the time series as well as a graphical illustration of them please refer to Sections 2 and 3 and Figure 4, respectively, of the manuscript below.\nFor manipulation purposes, the data is organized into eleven folders, each containing the number of measurements per chemical class identity and nominal concentration indicated above and described in the Table 2 of the manuscript. For example the folder named \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Toluene_200\u00e2\u20ac\u009d means the name of the gas identity is Toluene, which has been dosed at 200 ppmv. Each folder contains 6 folders, each representing the line location within the test area of the wind tunnel (location 1, L1, to location 6, L6, being L1 the closest point to the gas source) from which the set of time-series were recorded. In each of these folders there are 300 files, each of which corresponding to the number of measurements recorded at each location in the tunnel. The name of each file contains the exact log information of each of the measurements performed during the entire experiment, which is organized as follows. The first 12 digits of the file name (e.g., 201106060617) indicate the date and time at which each specific measurement was collected, starting from the year, month, day, and time. The last 4 digits in the following 19 characters of the name file, (e.g., board_setPoint_500V), indicate the fixed operating temperature value, represented by a voltage value applied to the embedded heating element in the chemical sensor, applied to the entire sensing platform, which can adopt nominal values from 4 to 6 V with an resolution value of 0.5 V. Note that the value 500V in the example is a graphical representation of the 5V value applied to the sensor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heater. For more details on the operating principles of the chemical sensors utilized in our platform please refer to Section 2 of the manuscript. The last 3 digits in the following 16 characters of the file name (e.g., fan_setPoint_060) indicates the set-point value of the nominal rotational speeds of the multiple-step motor-driven exhaust fan utilized to induce the distinct artificial airflows speed in the wind tunnel. Only three values were adopted in this condition: the value \u00e2\u20ac\u0153000\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in the file name, which indicates the slowest rotational speed (1500 rpm), the value \u00e2\u20ac\u0153060\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, indicating the mid-point rotational speed value of the fan (3900rpm), and the value \u00e2\u20ac\u0153100\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, which refers to the fastest induced speed of the fan, 5500 rpm. The last 14 characters of the following string of 27 characters (e.g., mfc_setPoint_Toluene_200ppm) describe the analyte identity and concentration value for each particular measurement. Thus, the just mentioned example represents the class corresponding to the chemical analyte identity \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Toluene\u00e2\u20ac\u009d dosed at the nominal concentration value of 200 ppm. Finally, the last 2 or 3 digits in the name (e.g., \u00e2\u20ac\u0153p7\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) describe the line point location at which the chemo-sensory platform was located in the wind tunnel.

The waves with the frequency of 7 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 13 Hz over motor processing areas are called mu rhythm and reflect idling activity in motor areas. It is more pronounced when the subjects are at rest and at least a second before subjects initiate voluntary movement, the mu activity over the hemisphere contralateral to the region moved shows a decrease in amplitude and is called Event Related Desynchronization (ERD).\nFor the current study, EEG data was collected for 5 times on various days from a healthy right-handed subject of 25 years of age. The data was recorded on a Medelec Profile Digital EEG machine. The settings of high frequency filter 50 Hz, low frequency filter 1.6 Hz, notch filter 50 Hz, sensitivity 70 micro volts/mm, and a sampling rate of 256 Hz were used for the basic signal processing.\nEight EEG electrodes (C3, C4, P3, P4, F3, F4, T3, and T4) were placed according to the international standard 10-20 system of electrode placement. Bipolar and unipolar EEG was recorded from eight Ag/AgCI scalp electrodes, which were placed 2.5 cm anterior and posterior to the central electrodes C3 and C4 (left and right side of the hemisphere). A1 and A2 are reference electrodes. The reference electrodes are placed on the left and right ears and the ground electrode on the forehead. EOG (Electrooculogram) being a noise artifact, was derived from two electrodes, placed on the outer cantus of left and right eye in order to detect eye movement. These EOG signals are then used to eliminate eye movement artifacts.\nThe subject was asked to lie down comfortably in a relaxed position with eyes closed and advised to minimize eye movements. The EEG was recorded for the relaxed state for 5 minutes. Following this, an audio beep of 60 db and 0.91 sec. duration was given at the start and end of a 5 second epoch where the subject was asked to mentally plan lifting of the right hand thumb.

Primary o-ring erosion and/or blowby\n2. Primary o-ring erosion only\n\nThe two databases are identical except for the 2nd attribute of the 21st instance (confirmed by David Draper on 8/5/93).\n\nEdited from (Draper, 1993):\n\nThe motivation for collecting this database was the explosion of the USA Space Shuttle Challenger on 28 January, 1986. An investigation ensued into the reliability of the shuttle's propulsion system. The explosion was eventually traced to the failure of one of the three field joints on one of the two solid booster rockets. Each of these six field joints includes two O-rings, designated as primary and secondary, which fail when phenomena called erosion and blowby both occur.\n\nThe night before the launch a decision had to be made regarding launch safety. The discussion among engineers and managers leading to this decision included concern that the probability of failure of the O-rings depended on the temperature t at launch, which was forecase to be 31 degrees F. There are strong engineering reasons based on the composition of O-rings to support the judgment that failure probability may rise monotonically as temperature drops. One other variable, the pressure s at which safety testing for field join leaks was performed, was available, but its relevance to the failure process was unclear.\n\nDraper's paper includes a menacing figure graphing the number of field joints experiencing stress vs. liftoff temperature for the 23 shuttle flights previous to the Challenger disaster. No previous liftoff temperature was under 53 degrees F. Although tremendous extrapolation must be done from the given data to assess risk at 31 degrees F, it is obvious even to the layman \"to foresee the unacceptably high risk created by launching at 31 degrees F.\" For more information, see Draper (1993) or the other previous analyses.\n\nThe task is to predict the number of O-rings that will experience thermal distress for a given flight when the launch temperature is below freezing.", "Area": "Physical", "Number_of_Instances": "23", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Multivariate", "Name": "Challenger USA Space Shuttle O-Ring Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Challenger+USA+Space+Shuttle+O-Ring", "Attribute_Information": "1.

The documents were assembled and indexed with categories by personnel from Reuters Ltd. (Sam Dobbins, Mike Topliss, Steve Weinstein) and Carnegie Group, Inc. (Peggy Andersen, Monica Cellio, Phil Hayes, Laura Knecht, Irene Nirenburg) in 1987.\n\nIn 1990, the documents were made available by Reuters and CGI for research purposes to the Information Retrieval Laboratory (W. Bruce Croft, Director) of the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Formatting of the documents and production of associated data files was done in 1990 by David D. Lewis and Stephen Harding at the Information Retrieval Laboratory.\n\nFurther formatting and data file production was done in 1991 and 1992 by David D. Lewis and Peter Shoemaker at the Center for Information and Language Studies, University of Chicago. This version of the data was made available for anonymous FTP as \"Reuters-22173, Distribution 1.0\" in January 1993. From 1993 through 1996, Distribution 1.0 was hosted at a succession of FTP sites maintained by the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (W. Bruce Croft, Director) of the Computer Science Department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.\n\nAt the ACM SIGIR '96 conference in August, 1996 a group of text categorization researchers discussed how published results on Reuters-22173 could be made more comparable across studies. It was decided that a new version of collection should be produced with less ambiguous formatting, and including documentation carefully spelling out standard methods of using the collection. The opportunity would also be used to correct a variety of typographical and other errors in the categorization and formatting of the collection.\n\nSteve Finch and David D. Lewis did this cleanup of the collection September through November of 1996, relying heavily on Finch's SGML-tagged version of the collection from an earlier study. One result of the re-examination of the collection was the removal of 595 documents which were exact duplicates (based on identity of timestamps down to the second) of other documents in the collection. The new collection therefore has only 21,578 documents, and thus is called the Reuters-21578 collection. This README describes version 1.0 of this new collection, which we refer to as \"Reuters-21578, Distribution 1.0\".\n\nIn preparing the collection and documentation we have benefited from discussions with Eric Brown, William Cohen, Fred Damerau, Yoram Singer, Amit Singhal, and Yiming Yang, among many others.\n\nWe thank all the people and organizations listed above for their efforts and support, without which this collection would not exist.", "Area": "N/A", "Number_of_Instances": "21578", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Text", "Name": "Reuters-21578 Text Categorization Collection Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Reuters-21578+Text+Categorization+Collection", "Attribute_Information": "Reuters-21578, Distribution 1.0 includes five files (all-exchanges-strings.lc.txt, all-orgs-strings.lc.txt, all-people-strings.lc.txt, all-places-strings.lc.txt, and all-topics-strings.lc.txt) which list the names of *all* legal categories in each set.

It builds on the concept of ideal-placement, self-placement and induced-displacement. The ideal and mutual-displacement conditions represent extreme displacement variants and thus could represent boundary conditions for recognition algorithms. In contrast, self-placement reflects a users perception of how sensors could be attached, e.g., in a sports or lifestyle application. The dataset includes a wide range of physical activities (warm up, cool down and fitness exercises), sensor modalities (acceleration, rate of turn, magnetic field and quaternions) and participants (17 subjects). Apart from investigating sensor displacement, the dataset lend itself for benchmarking activity recognition techniques in ideal conditions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDataset summary:\n#Activities: 33\n#Sensors: 9\n#Subjects: 17\n#Scenarios: 3\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nACTIVITY SET:\nA1: Walking\nA2: Jogging\nA3: Running\nA4: Jump up\nA5: Jump front & back\nA6: Jump sideways\nA7: Jump leg/arms open/closed\nA8: Jump rope\nA9: Trunk twist (arms outstretched)\nA10: Trunk twist (elbows bent)\nA11: Waist bends forward\nA12: Waist rotation\nA13: Waist bends (reach foot with opposite hand)\nA14: Reach heels backwards\nA15: Lateral bend (10_ to the left + 10_ to the right)\nA16: Lateral bend with arm up (10_ to the left + 10_ to the right)\nA17: Repetitive forward stretching\nA18: Upper trunk and lower body opposite twist\nA19: Lateral elevation of arms\nA20: Frontal elevation of arms\nA21: Frontal hand claps\nA22: Frontal crossing of arms\nA23: Shoulders high-amplitude rotation\nA24: Shoulders low-amplitude rotation\nA25: Arms inner rotation\nA26: Knees (alternating) to the breast\nA27: Heels (alternating) to the backside\nA28: Knees bending (crouching)\nA29: Knees (alternating) bending forward\nA30: Rotation on the knees\nA31: Rowing\nA32: Elliptical bike\nA33: Cycling\n\nSENSOR SETUP:\nEach sensor provides 3D acceleration (accX,accY,accZ), 3D gyro (gyrX,gyrY,gyrZ), 3D magnetic field orientation (magX,magY,magZ) and 4D quaternions (Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4). The sensors are identified according to the body part on which is placed respectively:\n\nS1: left calf (LC)\nS2: left thigh (LT)\nS3: right calf (RC)\nS4: right thigh (RT)\nS5: back (BACK)\nS6: left lower arm (LLA)\nS7: left upper arm (LUA)\nS8: right lower arm (RLA)\nS9: right upper arm (RUA)\n\nSCENARIOS:\nThe dataset contains information for three different scenarios depending on whether the sensors are positioned on predefined positions or placed by the users themselves.\n- Ideal-placement or the default scenario. The sensors are positioned by the instructor on predefined locations within each body part. The data stemming from this scenario could be considered as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153training set\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for supervised activity recognition systems.\n- Self-placement. The user is asked to position a subset of the sensors themselves on the body parts specified by the instructor, but without providing any hint on how the sensors must be exactly placed. This scenario is devised to investigate some of the variability that may occur in the day-to-day usage of an activity recognition system, involving wearable or self-attached sensors. Normally, the self-placement will lead to on-body sensor setups that differ from the ideal-placement. Nevertheless, this difference may be minimal if the subject places the sensor close to the ideal position.\n- Induced-displacement. An intentional mispositioning of sensors using rotations and translations with respect to the ideal placement is introduced by the instructor. One of the key interests of including this last scenario is to investigate how the performance of a certain method degrades as the system drifts far from the ideal setup.\n\nA complete and illustrated description (including table of activities, sensor setup, etc.) of the dataset is provided in the documentation facilitated along with the dataset.

Teams that are made up of students from only one\n# school are labeled local teams. Teams made up of students from more\n# than one school are labeled global teams. SAMs are collected from:\n# weekly timecards, instructor observations, and software engineering\n# tool usage logs. SAMs are then aggregated by team and time interval\n# (see next section) into TAMs (Team Activity Measure). Outcomes are\n# determined at the end of the semester through evaluation of student\n# team work in two categories: software engineering process (how well\n# the team applied best software engineering practices), and software\n# engineering product (the quality of the finished product the team\n# produced). Thus for each team, two outcomes are determined, process\n# and product, respectively. Outcomes are classified into two class\n# grades, A or F. A represents teams that are at or above\n# expectations, F represents teams that are below expectations or need\n# attention. For more information, please see the paper referenced\n# above.\n#\n# The SE process and SE product outcomes represent ML training classes\n# and are to be considered separately, e.g. one should train ML for SE\n# process separately from training for SE product.\n#\n# TIME INTERVALS FOR WHICH DATA IS COLLECTED\n# ------------------------------------------\n# Data collected continuously throughout the semester are aggregated\n# into different time intervals for the semester's project reflecting\n# different dynamics of teamwork during the class. Time intervals\n# represent time periods in which a milestone was developed by each\n# team. A milestone represents a major deliverable point in the class\n# for all student teams. The milestones are roughly divided into the\n# following topics:\n#\n# M1 - high level requirements and specs\n# M2 - more detailed requirements and specs\n# M3 - first prototype\n# M4 - beta release\n# M5 - final delivery\n#\n# Time intervals are combinations of the time in which milestones are\n# being produced. Time intervals are used in research only.\n#\n# In addition to time intervals corresponding to milestones, a number\n# of time intervals combining multiple T1-T5 time intervals have been\n# calculated. This was done to group student activities into design\n# vs. implementation phases which have different dynamics.\n#\n# These time intervals are defined as follows:\n#\n# Time Interval Corresponding Milestone Periods in Class\n# ----------------- --------------------------------------------\n# 0 Milestone 0\n# 1 Milestone 1\n# 2 Milestone 2\n# 3 Milestone 3\n# 4 Milestone 4\n# 5 Milestone 5\n# 6 Milestone 1 - Milestone 2 inclusive\n# 7 Milestone 1 - Milestone 3 inclusive\n# 8 Milestone 1 - Milestone 4 inclusive\n# 9 Milestone 1 - Milestone 5 inclusive\n# 10 Milestone 4 - Milestone 5 inclusive\n# 11 Milestone 3 - Milestone 5 inclusive\n#\n#\n#\n# SETAP PROJECT OVERALL DATA STATISTICS\n# ==================================================================\n# The following is a set of statistics about the entire dataset which\n# may be useful in the configuration of machine learning methods.\n#\n# This data was collected only from students at SFSU.

By using this systematic approach, TAM feature names are\n# produced that are human understandable and intuitive and related to\n# aggregation method.\n#\n#\n# There are a number of base TAM which are then aggregated into\n# aggregated TAM.\n#\n# BASE TAM\n# --------\n#\n# General TAM\n# -----------\n# The following TAMs are collected for each team: Year, semester,\n# timeInterval, teamNumber, semesterId, teamMemberCount,\n# femaleTeamMembersPercent, teamLeadGender, teamDistribution\n#\n# Calculated TAM\n# --------------\n# For each team, TAM were calculated from SAMs for every time interval\n# Ti. The core TAM variables where for each we compute as applicable:\n# count, average, standard deviation over weeks, over students etc.\n#\n# TAMs collected by Weekly Time Cards (WTS) TAM\n# ---------------------------------------------\n# teamMemberResponseCount, meetingHours, inPersonMeetingHours.\n# nonCodingDeliverablesHours, codingDeliverablesHours, helpHours,\n# globalLeadAdminHours, LeadAdminHoursResponseCount,\n# GlobalLeadAdminHoursResponseCount\n#\n# TAMs collected by Tool Logs (TL) TAM\n# -------------------------------------\n# commitCount, uniqueCommitMessageCount, uniqueCommitMessagePercent,\n# CommitMessageLength\n#\n# Collected by Instructor Observations (IO) TAMs\n# ------------------------------------------------\n# issueCount, onTimeIssueCount, lateIssueCount\n#\n#\n# AGGREGATED TAM\n# --------------\n#\n# Several aggregation method and derived variable names for TAMs\n# reflect how the core TAM variables were aggregated in final TAM\n# measures for each time interval Ti:\n#\n# Let VAR be the core TAM variable above. The naming conventions and\n# aggregation operators to obtain TAMs for each time interval Ti were\n# as follows:\n#\n# Total - total sum of VAR in the time interval Ti\n# Average - average of VAR in the time interval\n# StandardDeviation - SD of variable in time interval\n# Count - count of events measured by VAR (e.g. missed\n# checkpoints) in time interval\n# AverageByWeek - total sum/count of VAR in the time interval\n# divided by weeks in time interval\n# StandradDeviationByWeek - the standard devation of the weekly\n# total of VAR taken over the time interval\n# AverageByStudent - total count/sum of VAR in time interval,\n# divided by number of students in the team\n# StandardDeviation ByStudent - standard deviation of VAR in the\n# time interval, over students in the team\n#\n#\n# NULL VALUES\n# -----------\n# NULL values are used in the training data to indicate that no SAMs\n# were recorded in that particular time period, week, or for that\n# student.\n#\n# Frequently TAM features involving teamLeadHours or globalTeamLead\n# hours will result in a NULL for a particular training sample. For\n# local team leads, that usually means that the local team lead did\n# not complete any timecard surveys for the aggregation in quesiton.\n# While for global team lead TAM features this may also be the case,\n# the more usual cause of NULLS in global team lead TAM features comes\n# from the fact that most teams are not global, and therefore this\n# statistic was not gathered for these teams.\n#\n# It is left to the individual researcher to decide how to accomodate\n# NULL values, and the data is included in this file. Though these\n# may not be useful for machine learning directly, valuable\n# information can be obatined with some processing.\n#\n# TAM FEATURES\n# ------------\n# The following is a list of tam features available in the data files.\n# The TAM feature names are listed in the order in which the data\n# appear in each training sample, i.e. the first feature corresponds\n# to the first column, the second feature corresponds to the second\n# column, etc.\n#\n# The first sample line in the data section of the data file is not a\n# true sample, but consists of TAM feature names, which allows for\n# easy import into spreadsheets and for human readability.\n#\n# The final two TAM features (columns) are the outcome data for\n# process and product, and are the last two columns in each sample\n# row. The training sample data follow the header comment section.\n#\n#\n# TAM FEATURE LIST\n# ----------------\n# year\n# semester\n# timeInterval\n# teamNumber\n# semesterId\n# teamMemberCount\n#

They are deposited here in .txt form for easy accessibility (and as a convenience to users, have had results included for each recommendation).\nA .pdf version of the original recommendations file was certified by Digistamp (.p7s) at time of creation each day for stringent auditability. Please contact info '@' zzalpha.com if you desire to purchase the set of the certified .pdf, .p7s file pairs. The certified set contains only the recommendations, not the results included in the deposited set here.\nFor convenience, the data deposited includes calculated returns (outcomes) for each recommended transaction. The returns obviously were not part of the original recommendations when made, but were appended later. Returns were calculated several days after sale day.\nThe date inside the file reflects the date for which morning trading recommendation was made. The evaluation of the recommendations, as described in the KDD 2015 article mentioned above, involved comparison of the opening price of the day of recommendation to the opening price five market days later. As mentioned in the article, evaluation must be adjusted by trading costs and constraints.\nA recommendation portfolio consists of a segment, a size (1,2,5,10,20), and a side (Long or Short), and the ticker symbols of the companies recommended for price increase (or decrease in the case of Short) from the opening price to the opening price 5 trading days later.\nThe stocks included must first pass a general screen of $3 recent price and 80,000 recent daily average share volume for inclusion. Thus penny stocks and micro-caps are not present and even some large cap, but very low prices stocks are omitted. All stocks must be traded on NYSE, NASDAQ or AMEX at the time of recommendation.\nThe daily file contains all recommendations for all portfolios for the day. Both long and short recommendations are included. Long entries have duplicates.\n\nThese are the portfolios: (Note other portfolios limited to ETFs (exchange traded funds) may be listed each day. Due to data issues those are incomplete across the time period.)\n\n\n5. Number of Instances: 755 market days, 41 portfolios, 5 sizes of portfolios, Long and Short\n6. Number of Attributes\nThe data set submitted does not include attributes used for prediction. This data is provided as a benchmark of machine learning results in a longitudinal 3 yr period.\n\nHere is a sample content of a line in the files:\n\nJan 04 2005_006 Big_100_5_LONG_SHORT_F.pdf, L, AA 0.959 =25.97/27.09, AMAT 0.950 =14.70/15.46, EBAY 0.930 =53.33/57.31, PFE 0.995 =19.84/19.95, UPS 0.980 =71.72/73.16, Avg of 5 = 0.963\n\nThe above indicates recommendations were made before market open on Jan 4, 2005. This portfolio was limited to the biggest 100 cap stocks and was of size 5. It was for 'L' or long recommendations. The five stocks recommended are shown by ticker, result, price at sale divided by price at purchase. The average for the five is shown.\n\n\nNote: The user of this data set must implement its own parser of these files. The contributor does NOT provide one.\nNote: The prices used are adjusted prices based on data when results were calculated. Back-calculation of the adjusted prices using newer data may give different prices, but the ratios will remain the same (+/- rounding errors).\n\n7. For Each Attribute: Not applicable\n8. Missing Attribute Values: On some days for a few portfolios, results may be missing. These are tagged as 'missing'.\n9.

The devices measure the RSS of the beacon packets they exchange among themselves in the WSN [2].\n\nWe collect RSS data using IRIS nodes embedding a Chipcon AT86RF230 radio subsystem that implements the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and programmed with a TinyOS firmware. They are placed on the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chest and ankles. For the purpose of communications, the beacon packets are exchanged by using a simple virtual token protocol that completes its execution in a time slot of 50 milliseconds. A modified version of the Spin ([Web Link]) token-passing protocol is used to schedule node transmission, in order to prevent packet collisions and maintain high data collection rate. When an anchor is transmitting, all other anchors receive the packet and perform the RSS measurements. The payload of the transmitting packet is the set of RSS values between the transmitting node and the other sensors sampled during the previous cycle.\n\nFrom the raw data we extract time-domain features to compress the time series and slightly remove noise and correlations.\n\nWe choose an epoch time of 250 milliseconds according to the EVAAL technical annex. In such a time slot we elaborate 5 samples of RSS (sampled at 20 Hz) for each of the three couples of WSN nodes (i.e. Chest-Right Ankle, Chest-Left Ankle, Right Ankle-Left Ankle). The features include the mean value and standard deviation for each reciprocal RSS reading from worn WSN sensors.\n\nFor each activity 15 temporal sequences of input RSS data are present.

Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays, taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leaks through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing reconstruction of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons get collected, in patterns (called the shower image), allowing to discriminate statistically those caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background).\n\nTypically, the image of a shower after some pre-processing is an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, i.e. if the telescope axis is directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane, which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse. If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination. There are, in addition, further discriminating characteristics, like the extent of the cluster in the image plane, or the total sum of depositions.\n\nThe data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in:\nD.

It also contains the ground truth collected from both expert image inspection and histology (in an xlsx file). There are features vectors for 76 lesions, and there are 3 types of lesion: hyperplasic, adenoma and serrated adenoma. It is possible to consider this classification problem as a binary one by combining adenoma and serrated adenoma in the same class. According to this, hyperplasic lesions would belong to the class 'benign' while the other two types of gastrointestinal lesions would go to the 'malignant' class.\n\nThe first line/row of the dataset corresponds to the lesion name (text label). Every lesion appears twice because it has been recorded using two types of lights: white light (WL) and narrow band imaging (NBI). The second line/row represents the type of lesion (3 for adenoma, 1 for hyperplasic, and 2 for serrated). And, finally, the third line/row is the type of light used (1 for WL and 2 for NBI). All other rows are the raw features (without any kind of preprocessing):\n422 2D TEXTURAL FEATURES\n- First 166 features: AHT: Autocorrelation Homogeneous Texture (Invariant Gabor Texture)\n- Next 256: Rotational Invariant LBP\n76 2D COLOR FEATURES\n- 16 Color Naming\n- 13 Discriminative Color\n- 7 Hue\n- 7 Opponent\n- 33 color gray-level co-occurrence matrix\n200 3D SHAPE FEATURES\n- 100 shapeDNA\n- 100 KPCA\n\nThe main objective of this dataset is to study how good computers can be at diagnosing gastrointestinal lesions from regular colonoscopic videos. In order to compare the performance of machine learning methods with the one offered by humans, we provide the file ground_truth.xlsx that includes the ground truth after histopathology and the opinion of 7 clinicians (4 experts and 3 beginners). An automatic tissue classification approach could save clinician's time by avoiding chromoendoscopy, a time-consuming staining procedure using indigo carmine, as well as could help to assess the severity of individual lesions in patients with many polyps, so that the gastroenterologist would directly focus on those requiring polypectomy. A possible way of proceeding with the classification is to concatenate the information from the two types of light for each lesion, i.e. create a single vector of 1396 elements per lesion.\n\nThe technical goal is to maximize accuracy while minimizing false positives (lesions that do not need resection but that are classified as if they do) and false negatives (lesions that do need resection but that are classified as if they do not need it). In particular, we are specially interested on maximizing accuracy while reducing false negatives, i.e. minimizing the number of adenoma and serrated adenoma that are classified as hyperplasic. The opposite case is not that serious: the resection of a hyperplasic polyp considering it as an adenoma or serrated adenoma. Another interesting experiment would consist on compare the performance of the best machine learning method we can get with the one provided by human operators (experts and beginners).\n\nThe best results obtained so far, in the binary case, using leave-one-out and Random Forest with 1000 trees (using color+texture+3D with NBI), corresponded to an accuracy of ~89,5%, sensitivity ~94,5% and specificity ~76% (considering as positive condition the resection).

The learning system is provided with examples of chess positions described only by the coordinates of the pieces on the board. Background knowledge in the form of row and column differences is also supplied. The relations necessary to form a correct and concise classifier for the target concept must be discovered by the learning system (the examples already provide a complete extensional definition). The task is closely related to Quinlan's (1983) application of ID3 to classify White King and Rook against Black King and Knight (KRKN) positions as lost 2-ply or lost 3-ply. The framework is similar in that the example positions supply only low-grade data. An important difference is that additional background predicates of the kind supplied in the KRKN study via hand-crafted attributes are not provided for this KRK domain.\n\nChess endgames are complex domains which are enumerable. Endgame databases are tables of stored game-theoretic values for the enumerated elements (legal positions) of the domain. The game-theoretic values stored denote whether or not positions are won for either side, or include also the depth of win (number of moves) assuming minimax-optimal play. From the point of view of experiments on computer induction such databases provide not only a source of examples but also an oracle (Roycroft, 1986) for testing induced rules. However a chess endgame database differs from, say, a relational database containing details of parts and suppliers in the following important respect. The combinatorics of computing the required game-theoretic values for individual position entries independently would be prohibitive. Therefore all the database entries are generated in a single iterative process using the ``standard backup'' algorithm (Thompson, 1986).\n\nA KRK database was described by Clarke (1977). The current database was described and used for machine learning experiments in Bain (1992; 1994). It should be noted that our database is not guaranteed correct, but the class distribution is the same as Clarke's database. In (Bain 1992; 1994) the task was classification of positions in the database as won for white in a fixed number of moves, assuming optimal play by both sides. The problem was structured into separate sub-problems by depth-of-win ordered draw, zero, one, ..., sixteen. When learning depth d all examples at depths > d are used as negatives. Quinlan (1994) applied Foil to learn a complete and correct solution for this task.\n\nThe typical complexity of induced classifiers in this domain suggest that the task is demanding when background knowledge is restricted.", "Area": "Game", "Number_of_Instances": "28056", "Data_Set_Characteristics": "Multivariate", "Name": "Chess (King-Rook vs. King) Data Set", "Link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chess+%28King-Rook+vs.+King%29", "Attribute_Information": "1.

The first step in the discovery of a new drug is usually to identify and isolate the receptor to which it should bind, followed by testing many small molecules for their ability to bind to the target site. This leaves researchers with the task of determining what separates the active (binding) compounds from the inactive (non-binding) ones. Such a determination can then be used in the design of new compounds that not only bind, but also have all the other properties required for a drug (solubility, oral absorption, lack of side effects, appropriate duration of action, toxicity, etc.).\nThe original data were modified for the purpose of the feature selection challenge.
